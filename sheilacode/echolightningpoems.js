flew over moss riven<br/>
boulders broken from the mother stone<br/>

over the fens<br/>

through the wordless<br/>
winds and migrations<br/>
flew over graves<br/>

in a cascade of notes<br/>
which is not endless<br/>
but aching and sweet<br/>
like iridescent feathers<br/>
of wings that rise and fall<br/>
in the circle of migration<br/>
in each flight<br/>
music that we breathe<br/>

Love goes on in spite of the quarrels<br/>
<span class="indent1">in spite of leavings, broken hearts, rejected rites</span><br/>
<span class="indent2">discarded love letters, promises never kept</span><br/>
love goes on in face of all its failures<br/>
<span class="indent1">betrayals, reverse in fortunes</span><br/>
<span class="indent2">formidable opponents, competing needs.</span><br/>
Love goes on and on<br/>
<span class="indent1">if not above ground then under, if not under</span><br/>
<span class="indent2">then through, if not through</span><br/>
<span class="indent3">then around, if not around, then over</span><br/>
and over, if not you, then another, if not<br/>
<span class="indent1">another then another.</span><br/>
<span class="indent2">Love goes on</span><br/>
<span class="indent3">slips out of our grasp</span><br/>
<span class="indent4">travels upon the roads</span><br/>
<span class="indent5">falls like rain and</span><br/>
floods and evaporates only to rain elsewhere.<br/>
Love goes on here and elsewhere<br/>
<span class="indent1">beyond the bodies, the climax, the clasp</span><br/>
<span class="indent2">of hand and mouth and ribs and limbs.</span><br/>
Love is beyond the pain of it, the disdain of it<br/>
<span class="indent1">the stain of it, beyond the seed that falls</span><br/>
<span class="indent2">beneath the soil before</span><br/>
<span class="indent3">and after the rain that splits the seed open</span><br/>
<span class="indent4">the tendril that lifts its small stem</span><br/>
goes on to leaf and back to seed.<br/>
Love is this circle that we’re in<br/>
outside, inside, unsayable, unspeakable, unseeable<br/>
<span class="indent1">unknowable creator and destroyer.</span><br/>
Love, love, love, how grief rises<br/>
<span class="indent1">into dark stars.</span><br/>

Shore lifts as if breathing.<br/>
Inside the sky, origin of breath.<br/>
</p><p>
Blue strikes the horizon<br/>
while at my feet<br/>
water is cast in the chestnut tint<br/>
of yellow eyed ducks.<br/>
They swim in arcs.<br/>
</p><p>
Small pebbles unsettle the bottom.<br/>
</p><p>
The long heavy plank<br/>
of the past balances what’s next<br/>
close by, in this moment<br/>
</p><p>
submerged, a silence —<br/>
too distant to see<br/>
</p><p>
an indigo reply<br/>
to what nobody can ask.<br/>
</p><p>
On the dock, tables<br/>
fill with diners looking out to sea.<br/>
In the marina, boats<br/>
lift and fall<br/>
on their ropes.<br/>
</p><p>
Beyond that, the vessel drifts.<br/>
</p><p>
A lighthouse, breakwater, mist.<br/>
No language for what blurs<br/>
</p><p>
lines, waves,<br/>
fathoms, invisible stars.<br/>

Echo & Lightning is one woman’s love story that was written for cello music composed by Kathy McTavish. This book is an expanded version of a chapbook of the same title; also included are many poems from the audio CD, Undertow, and the chapbook, Fearful Journey.
This work is about change. “Dream”: The poem refers to lines from a Finnish poet, Helvi Juvonen. “I, a boulder split off the mother rock...” from her poem “The Boulder,” translated by Keith Bosley. The title “Loveroot, Silkthread” is a line from Walt Whitman’s Leaves of Grass. “Leda” (Version I and II) refer to Greek mythology, Leda and the Swan. “Thunder / Perfect Mind” borrows its title from the Gnostic text, Thunder, Perfect Mind.
