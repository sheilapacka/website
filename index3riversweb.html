</header><p>
In the boat, I slide over her body, the excavation. 
She is slag. She is crushed stone. 
Unburied, geologic, Mesabi iron. 
I drift over knee and shin and float over her shattered self, heaped upon the earth. 
Over boulders submerged. 
Veins broken open, emptied and made into freight.
</p><p>
A cold current from the drift. 
The bow lifts. 
She is bedrock, the bottom of the continent. 
Through her runs dark and invisible rivers without shore. She is the Divide. 
In the seams of the tectonic plates, she is lit with dynamite and extracted, mined, carried by trains to the ships. 
I see a shoulder of iron. 
In place of her head, a deep shaft.
</p><p>
Remade, she becomes steel, becomes bridge, becomes beam. 
Ship and tank and weapon. 
At the end, junk in the junkyards rusting into the weeds.
</p><p>
^<br/>
The vessel turns like the needle of a compass broken from its post. 
I hear the tail splash of a trout. 
Fish spiral along the perimeter inside the pit. 
Inside, a winding road once traveled, in shifts, by men in hard hats in dump trucks and steam shovels. 
The trout tend the broken cables, the skeletal rusted frames.
</p><p>
Stained with ore, the water feels like ice. 
It rises. 
Engineers call it water gain: precipitation, surface water inflow, a rise in the water table, a threat to the walls of the pit. 
Light falls but can’t find bottom three hundred feet below. 
Circles tumble and bend beneath the water’s surface. 
I hear the gravel sliding in. 
I hear insects and bird wings over the factory of the deep.
</p><p>
^<br/>
Cold blue from afar, but near, the water goes amber. 
It magnifies the hand that I plunge beneath the surface. 
It breaks the lines of my body, her body. 
The vessel. 
Ore rises into dust, condenses into a red mist of atoms, becomes discharge, industrial contamination. 
We break the surface. 
We sink and rise.

		<i>An acre of music or a room closer to it</i><br/> — Lorine Niedecker
		</div><p>
^<br/>
The minerals whisper: iron, manganese,<br/>
copper, nickel, platinum, and titanium.<br/>
On the Laurentian Divide, one river falls over stones<br/>
to Hudson Bay. Another falls south through fields<br/>
to the Mississippi. The third river goes east<br/>
through the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
Handfuls of water. A body of sea smoke, of wind,<br/>
a body of motion, an ocean without salt.<br/>
In the benthos, tailings from taconite mines.<br/>
In the basin, shipwrecks and broken bottles and sunken<br/>
barrels and bodies the lake has claimed.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
On a bridge made of paper, my voice turns to vapor.<br/>
On a bridge made of iron and steel<br/>
I veer between traction and black ice<br/>
wander through beams and woven branches<br/>
follow the rain in its tracks through roots and excavations.<br/>
I cross before, almost, never,<br/>
the thunder of interior dialogues<br/>
through heavy machinery.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
Practicing the old art,<br/>
my father once crossed the slope<br/>
holding a slender branch, calling the water.<br/>
Divining. Now, in a dark room, a daughter holds<br/>
a cello to her breast. In the instrument is the old tree.<br/>
The wood turns toward harmonics.<br/>
The bow rises, glides, floats above the bridge.<br/>
Calls of the geese overhead vibrate<br/>
against the windowpane. Her fingers tremble<br/>
like strings and the water answers.<br/>
A car comes down the street. The driver<br/>
locked in a dream, rolls down the hill. Slower.<br/>
Still. The branch dips and the invisible flows<br/>
into containers. The forked branch<br/>
didn’t know it had lost its root.<br/>
It only had yearning.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
I call the rivers in the forgotten language<br/>
call the Sawtooth Mountains,<br/>
forested slopes with snowshoe hares and deer beds<br/>
and bears’ dens and lynx.<br/>
I call shore’s perpetual threshold.<br/>
In the city, in a house, I call a moth<br/>
caught between two panes of glass.<br/>
To catch it will damage the wings.<br/>
To leave it means it will perish.<br/>
I write of the trapped and desperate flight.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
No one can follow the map of the bees.<br/>
Their business is in every direction,<br/>
from tiger lilies into the hives to the chives<br/>
to other realms with heads of clover.<br/>
Apple blossoms. In the lavender colonnades<br/>
of mint through the rooms of June<br/>
into purple irises, yellow daylilies, deep inside<br/>
delicate tunnels with hardly a foothold<br/>
hidden in clouds of pollen.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
Along Fourth Street, the rapids climb a bed of stones<br/>
amid revelers, but alone<br/>
over a steep slope with winter’s melt<br/>
below a bridge, a bird on a wire, hidden by trees<br/>
past a canvas tent and pillow with nobody home<br/>
the constellation of Orion<br/>
roams through clouds and goes on a shifting path<br/>
with the sleepless river, plunging deep.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
A river catches herself as she is falling.<br/>
She is a cloud that breaks open and the earth<br/>
that holds the seed as it is broken.<br/>
The farther she has gone, the closer she comes.<br/>
The more she is lost, the more she has found.<br/>
Her body is formed by what she touches.<br/>
Blind, she sees. Deaf, she hears.<br/>
The wind is her breathing. In her emptiness<br/>
she fills. In her erasures, she is writing.<br/>
The colder the air, the deeper she goes.<br/>
The more that it rains, the more rain she carries.<br/>
The more stones in her path, the more that she laughs.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
A blueprint on a scroll of paper: a bridge is built<br/>
for floating on air, but heavily, on pylons<br/>
wading in plaits of current.<br/>
Passengers go between steel cables and arches<br/>
and bows, through quicksilver and mercury and yellow.<br/>
The homeless meander below.<br/>
This bridge, made to join, to cast a permanent shadow.<br/>
This bridge, made to resist wind and gravity.<br/>
This bridge made, above all, to echo and hum.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
Between the steel rails on ramps of forward and back<br/>
I merge in the traffic. In the union of opposing forces<br/>
each has its own lane. Through ribs of steel and spider webs.<br/>
Once in a dark kitchen, there was an old woman sifting.<br/>
The flour falls through the screen.<br/>
Once the oil of the lamp climbed a wick<br/>
lit a small conflagration above the round oak table<br/>
in a circle of chairs, a murmuring, a call for grace.<br/>
The roar of a flame mingles with<br/>
the chink of forks and knives.<br/>
A man, injured in the mine, lies in his bed.<br/>
On the bridge, red brake lights. Cars surge<br/>
past a blur of years suspended in fine dust.<br/>
The bridge sways.<br/> 
Wheels stir the filaments, litter drifts<br/>
where words can’t reach.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
On foot. On the span, falling without falling.<br/>
Say I cross the bridge,<br/>
although it is windy and missteps are fatal.<br/>
Say clouds cover the moon and I cross borders<br/>
without knowing. Say the wind blows at my clothes,<br/>
strips me of my protection<br/>
and I lose my footing. Say I fall through the night<br/>
break through the surface in a cold fire.<br/>
Say I vacate — abandon my saying,<br/>
withdraw my breath, take my hands from my hands,<br/>
twist from my shoulders. Say I walk or am carried<br/>
to the place before birth, the place where the sun<br/>
comes as a ribbon of heat.<br/>
Say I arrive in another language,<br/>
wings lifting and landing,<br/>
to speak with a wild tongue.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
Here, a sketch of shore. The pencil draws<br/>
a water line, a vanishing point. In graphite,<br/>
wings of a bird in flight. Two more curves,<br/>
parabolas that float. Next, between the boat’s ribs, a bench.<br/>
A wave on the water’s surface — not much — just grasses<br/>
bent beneath a wind. Then a shadow, three-dimensional.<br/>
There’s a need to leave things out. In the silence<br/>
those that peer uneasily, advance, and then withdraw.<br/>
Granite outcroppings — broken by ice.<br/>
Already the currents pull and the hull lifts and sways,
restless. I render this as if I were — disembarked —<br/>
without a body, without a shadow, a current of air.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
Jointed and broken, the skeletal hand raked the beach.<br/>
It drifted and reached, five long finger bones bleached<br/>
and worn clean. A hand and nothing else.<br/>
Was it a bear? A deceased? Wind blew from the northeast.<br/>
No other bones to be seen — no other walkers.<br/>
Grass was chased over the dunes. Trees leaned<br/>
away from the sea. Clouds lifted in each crest.<br/>
Pebbles unsettled the bottom, rode through the knuckles<br/>
and left no print. The water was sky,<br/>
clear and tinted with old blood or rust, rot of fish<br/>
and soft ice. Inside were rivers and constellations,<br/>
storm wrecks and lives ground into splinters.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
In the hollow of the body, a crow comes with a sharp beak.<br/>
The door of the chamber opens and closes.<br/>
I cannot translate this well. The arteries are open.<br/>
There is nothing apparent, the same pressure as always.<br/>
Life goes on. The crow grows a long shadow<br/>
and takes short flights along low branches.<br/>
I walk under the trees when the days are short.<br/>
The crow flaps its rough wings and squawks.<br/>
This what you call death, she says, I eat.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
Here, bulbs are forced to bloom. They are planted<br/>
in the ground before winter.<br/>
Here, mouths are filled with soil. Those<br/>
who entered the tomb and grew roots<br/>
and walked in cold layers<br/>
to draw the minerals out. Those are the ones<br/>
who yield to the shovel and receive the bones,<br/>
those are the ones who weave a net and lift the stones.<br/>
There are those who seep or are swept<br/>
into the underground river, who decay and are kept and yet,<br/>
rise in a tender green stem to carry new buds.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
I walk over the narrow holes of diamond drillers.<br/>
Above the horizon, seagulls draw arcs in flight.<br/>
In the morning on shore, sandpipers run on wet sand.<br/>
Feathers lift and fall, driven by wind’s breath.<br/>
I find, half buried in the sand, lost thresholds.<br/>
Scrolls of birch bark, small arches, angles<br/>
and grayed frames of doors that once opened and closed.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
In the city are those who cannot be traced.<br/>
In the city of good air and bad are ghost cities,<br/>
old cities, cities of war with lamps that no longer burn<br/>
but pierce the tongue, cities that write in smoke<br/>
in a book open to depredations and<br/>
cities that reassemble endings in a dark room<br/>
of unknown dimensions, suspend belief,<br/>
up-end the fields. In the city, I affix the disappeared<br/>
to sheets of onion skin with stains and smudges.<br/>
Trans-literate. Splice the image.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
My hand disappears over the horizon<br/>
and pulls up the sea for cover.<br/>
I travel as a cloud for miles, citizen of a bruised sky.<br/>
I cross the tides to climb the coast<br/>
follow roads to the interior<br/>
and rivers flow over my banks.<br/>
My border spans the continents, and my spine<br/>
grows into a mountain range.<br/>
My arms can’t carry the load.<br/>
The cast off, the rejected, the driven<br/>
and defenseless. Everywhere they come forth,<br/>
everywhere off course.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
Seagulls wheel. The hidden drifts.<br/>
Freighters and ships embark<br/>
in the harbor, trembling with heat,<br/>
breathe cold vapor<br/>
and speak in the language of horns.<br/>
In their wake, the undocumented<br/>
travel with currents that carry the vessel.<br/>
May it not sink.<br/>
May they not be detained or taken by claw or beak<br/>
or roll like driftwood on the bottom of the sea<br/>
but rise to their feet and climb the beach.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
To swing like a branch in a storm<br/>
whose edges are accelerating,<br/>
to heave with the waves in the slant of hurled rain.<br/>
To hear the thump and crack in the too-early dark,<br/>
see the electric pour into a hollow.<br/>
To find a vein and excavate,<br/>
see absences in the landscape.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
Strangers come to the edge and double back<br/>
because vessels are small and voices can carry,<br/>
because children are heavy and nothing is cheap,<br/>
because destinations are far and some roads lead nowhere<br/>
because fences are one thing and rivers another,<br/>
because rocks rise beneath the feet<br/>
and holes can be deep, because we look<br/>
at the water and don’t see any crossings,<br/>
because journeys disappear and time erases the map,<br/>
because words cloud the distance<br/>
between us, because no matter how many have made it<br/>
or how many have foundered, they still come,<br/>
because what falls from our grasp lands in the past,<br/>
because when the wind rises, waves make mountains to climb.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
Difficult, to move a border. To clear a forest.<br/>
Difficult even to open the furrows<br/>
in the field. We lift the seeds and scatter.<br/>
If we don’t cut every year, the forest will take over.<br/>
Imagine a beaver on the sandbar of Lake Superior.<br/>
She slides into the surf and emerges<br/>
with a piece of driftwood, in that heavy surf,<br/>
and lays the first beam of her house.<br/>
</p><p>

In the forest, most seeds flung by wind or wings<br/>
never sprout. Seedlings compete for the smallest bit of sun.<br/>
A white pine, one hundred feet tall,<br/>
can be felled by gooseberries.<br/>
Slash and burn feeds a coming year’s crop of blueberries.<br/>
The forest thrives on waste. Dark wings flutter.<br/>
A red-headed woodpecker knocks<br/>
on the houses of the dead and pulls the worms out.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
The center was never a destination.<br/>
Inside the fallen trunks are roads — circles around circles.<br/>
Insects in the canyons of bark travel with their bundles,<br/>
fall into the dark rooms of the camber,<br/>
get caught in rivers of sap turning to amber.<br/>
Anchored in the rot where so much thrives —<br/>
lichen reaches up to sketch on the rocks.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
A catbird hidden in the branches<br/>
whistles and squeaks and whines and mews.<br/>
A catbird says whatever it hears.<br/>
Short notes turn into phrases, are repeated.<br/>
She can see over the Divide a river of clouds.<br/>
She can hear underground, in the rivers that scour the drifts,<br/>
a moneyed sound.<br/>

^<br/>
Buried in the earth, held by frost<br/>
warmed by the sun<br/>
are four wave-worn stones.<br/>
</p><p>
Each is an egg<br/>
that will never hatch.<br/>
Each is a has been.<br/>
Each is yet to be.<br/>
Each has been delivered.<br/>
Each has been born of mineral<br/>
born of fire<br/>
born of pressure.<br/>
</p><p>
The shore has washed<br/>
our tracks,<br/>
wiped each day.<br/>
The shore has no memory<br/>
only stones.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
In the sound of water<br/>
I remember<br/>
all the launches we made,<br/>
the landings.<br/>
</p><p>
Remember my mother’s morning task,<br/>
the wash.<br/>
Her waves in a machine,<br/>
the swish and flap of wet<br/>
clothes she wrung<br/>
and hung on lines,<br/>
small stones beneath her feet.<br/>
</p><p>
Remember a trip to the cold lake.<br/>
We slipped on stones and waded in.<br/>
skipped flat stones across<br/>
the surface and swam.<br/>
Cold water behind the ear drum<br/>
trickled from our ears.<br/>
</p><p>
Remember the bridge<br/>
over the bay,<br/>
the beach where<br/>
we laid in the sun.<br/>
</p><p>
In the sauna, fire roared<br/>
in the stove<br/>
and heated the round stones.<br/>
We sweated<br/>
threw more water<br/>
that hissed back with steam.<br/>
Laid cold cloths on our faces.<br/>
Cooled our naked bodies<br/>
with buckets of cold lake water<br/>
rubbed our peached skin<br/>
with rough towels.<br/>
</p><p>
Remember betrothals<br/>
and births<br/>
the baptisms.<br/>
The paddle splash and canoe that<br/>
broke the waves.<br/>
</p><p>
Over the sound of waves<br/>
was the sound of birds.<br/>
</p><p>
The shore comes up<br/>
all the time.<br/>
The wind has fallen to nothing.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
These stones are time in my hands.<br/>
They have been broken by ice.<br/>
They’ve been in an ocean’s<br/>
embrace and know<br/>
the motion that falls and rises.<br/>
</p><p>
Stones ride the continents’ drift.<br/>
They fold.<br/>
The stones are born of weight.<br/>
</p><p>
They remember tectonic plates<br/>
the asteroid and endless winter.<br/>
</p><p>
A stone can hold even<br/>
a bird’s tracks. Memory<br/>
momentary and heavy.<br/>
</p><p>
Each leaves a trace.<br/>
</p><p>
The ocean knows the wind’s hand<br/>
and wind knows<br/>
how it can be driven wild by fire.<br/>
The stones roll in the sea<br/>
that rolls and rolls.<br/>
</p><p>
Edges join. The stones round<br/>
each other.<br/>
Seagulls shriek.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
Each stone’s weight<br/>
isn’t always its center.<br/>
Each stone feels my hand like a wave.<br/>
I stack four in the wind<br/>
as if to say, stones have a body.<br/>
A body who won’t stay.<br/>

I was born into another language, my mother’s tongue,<br/>
shore to sapphire and stones, music of accordions,<br/>
tailgate parties, and night-time arguments.<br/>
</p><p>
Instead of beginning, expect hidden sources,<br/>
underground springs. A brogue, a Finnish tongue.<br/>
I slept in her silences, in the sound of falling water,<br/>
</p><p>
learned to swim by drowning.<br/>
I poured sentences into waves that rose into crests and broke,<br/>
rolled my r’s like surf and swallowed the mist, toxic waste,<br/>
</p><p>
green organic matter.<br/>
This is where I wade, oblivious to the drop off.<br/>
Pebbles ground down to syllables and vowels.<br/>
</p><p>
All the same, according to the river, erosion and accretion,<br/>
migration and digression.<br/>
Now is the river and now and now it’s losing ground.<br/>
</p><p>
Nothing stops here. And her, she bewilders.<br/>
Wilder for a moment, then idler. Ice or vapor.<br/>
In shallows or in the deep, meanders.<br/>
</p><p>
Asleep in the river, a channel open<br/>
goes through violence and its after-wash,<br/>
through silence and sibilance and distant acquaintance,<br/>
</p><p>
a place to join instead to begin, a place of apprehension,<br/>
of tension, of fluid dynamics, all her saying now<br/>
an altered and muted underground music.<br/>

Grandmother poured a shot of brandy into her coffee. 
Puna, she called it. 
Always an apron and black shoes with thick heels and thin laces. 
The liquor bottle in the kitchen cabinet, top shelf, on the Iron Range. 
My grandfather was already gone. 
In several directions. 
They migrated from Finland and I was lost in their language. 
Years later, I learned puna meant red. 
I learned the word for river, joki, 
sounding like yoke key.
</p><p>
^<br/>
The pendulum clock knocks in the night and strikes the hours with small bells. 
The chrome kitchen table and yellow Naugahyde chairs listened to the empty rooms, pale green and the carpet, deep green. 
On the wall, a pastoral: cows heading toward a barn and a horse-drawn wagon on a road, never arriving. 
Nearby are silhouettes, framed, and a family portrait with my grandfather at the center, passed out near a kerosene stove below a ceiling vent. 
A television connected to an antenna. 
Behind its convex glass, interference.
</p><p>
^<br/>
When my mother was small, there were ten children in a two-bedroom house. 
Too many mouths, not enough hands. 
Shadows with a long reach. 
In the hallway, a Singer sewing machine, a pincushion, a basket of unfinished business, wool scraps to make a weighty blanket for the bed. 
Don’t think about the past, my mother said. 
I was not released. 
In the kitchen, she stood at a white porcelain sink with cold water only. 
It drained into a slop bucket behind a white curtain. 
One must remember to take the bucket out. 
To wind the clock. 
To keep the pantry door open so it wouldn’t freeze. 
To leave things out.
</p><p>
^<br/>
No doors inside the house, just curtains with cabbage roses, maroon and pink. 
Outside the window, a view of clotheslines. 
In Toivola, the place that meant beautiful, she had an outhouse, a swamp full of tadpoles, and horseflies. 
Inside, a record player, a stack of 78s and 45s, Hank Williams, Johnny Cash, Patsy Cline. 
All the children left home early. 
Crickets. 
Grasshoppers. 
Cats.
</p><p>
^<br/>
In the barn, the hay slid into the stalls and hooves knocked on the barn floor. 
I saw tails tied up with binder twine and brown bottles of beer. 
This is where the bullets landed. 
Not in the flesh, only in the wood. If that was his aim. 
Acres of muskeg. 
The story was told but not to me. 
I heard whispers. 
It was over my head, and I couldn’t swim. 
Nights of lighted tobacco smoke and accordions. 
On the instruments, bellow clips and register switches. 
Inside, reeds and wax. 
</p><p>
^<br/>
Outside, push and pull. 
I realize the way my eyes deceive me. 
I went back, walked on the same ground, looked to the other country, the places where my grandmother left. 
Why did she leave? Why did she stay? I heard hands playing the instruments, and the sound of falling water. 
The swish of taffeta slips over secrets. 
The feet that said, Unohda! Forget it. 
The heels said, Ei kestä! Don’t mention it.

steep waterfall of clouds<br/>

Beneath the willow, l lay<br/>
my cheek on the shoulder of the river,<br/>
a cleft in the body of the earth.<br/>
It shines back to the sun, the river<br/>
through blades of grass and stones<br/>
from a white crest into mist through the fingers<br/>

pulling a dark stream.<br/>
Red roots stretch from the bank, listening.<br/>
Knots are tying, tangles unfurling<br/>
boulders shifting.<br/>

The indirection of wind fills the room<br/>
spider webs stretch.<br/>
Outside, frost and snow travel like snakes<br/>
over the cold streets.<br/>
We surround ourselves with digital fields<br/>

the dragline to climb.<br/>

^<br/>
In the orchestra, the conductor lifts his arm<br/>
reeds and muscles trade<br/>
</p><p>
with trembling strings.<br/>
The earth tilts a fraction of a degree.<br/>
</p><p>
Cymbals are struck, the sound un-leveling.<br/>
Horses gallop on distant pastures.<br/>
</p><p>
Hollows fill with water. The musicians sweat.<br/>
Flashes of silver and black. Burnished brass.<br/>
</p><p>
An ear for repercussions. The heartbeat of hooves.<br/>
Pearl moon on hot leather.<br/>
</p><p>
This body cannot contain its liberations,<br/>
nor the fire its sparks.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
Before the interment, we set the horses free.<br/>
They crossed the empty field<br/>
through shadow and made a path to the burial.<br/>
</p><p>
They gathered behind us.<br/>
The ground split with the weight of a man<br/>
and water filled the hollow.<br/>
</p><p>
I felt the shovel in my chest.<br/>
We placed the young man’s ashes, placed fallen feathers<br/>
into the underground river,<br/>
</p><p>
left notes. Words were taken, the soul<br/>
began to travel. The horses<br/>
retreated as if the last gate closed in their faces.<br/>
</p><p>
The weight is heavy.<br/>
I know the horses will return.<br/>
Eventually will go over, break free.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
At the funeral feast we push back our chairs.<br/>
In the ragged hymn, there’s the clang of plates,<br/>
a hundred horses, racing.<br/>
</p><p>
The body with its headache.<br/>
The body of the horse rises with its slopes<br/>
and glorious veins, dilating<br/>
</p><p>
into a poetry of silence. Of mares.<br/>
Meanwhile, a boat founders<br/>
in a hurricane beyond rescue.<br/>
</p><p>
Cries are heard behind glass.<br/>
Heat has risen, and there is need for<br/>
what will surely never come.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
Horses roll into the capillaries<br/>
and follow the conductor<br/>
from the concert hall to other listening walls.<br/>
Blooded, going forward,<br/>
</p><p>
at the pace of heartbeats.<br/>
Never for the last time, ice with vodka<br/>
and cranberry and lime,<br/>
blankets wet and steaming.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
A circle of quarter horses with braided manes<br/>
On diamonds, they prance<br/>
with iron shoes<br/>
</p><p>
on roads filled with strife.<br/>
On a dark night, a strike.<br/>
The sound of collapse:<br/>
</p><p>
one great wall and a country on its continent.<br/>
An opera in the house,<br/>
and a crisis on the measures.<br/>
</p><p>
The circle runs through graves and their instruments,<br/>
through Sibelius’ latitudes<br/>
the hands that held the reins.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
In horsepower, the soloist excels,<br/>
her fragile body<br/>
given over to its red violin.<br/>
</p><p>
She’s a racehorse. Ears back, ears forward.<br/>
In chaos and howling war,<br/>
the motion of flanks and haunches.<br/>
</p><p>
We can’t hear our own voices.<br/>
We can’t tune it out.<br/>
Heedless riders, in the ebb of sound.<br/>
</p><p>
Hay in the loft spontaneously combusted.<br/>
The staves burnt in a white heat.<br/>
When the wind dropped, we fell.<br/>
Got up again. Shoulders in.<br/>

in the headwaters at the top of the Divide.<br/>
I add it to the dark rags for my loom<br/>
</p><p>
add rock corings and depths of the great lake<br/>
to the warp, old growth and timbers that drift.<br/>
I ride rails between hills that are mine dumps,<br/>
in the wake of prospectors<br/>

the weft with strings of a broken horizon.<br/>
Between the breast beam and back beam<br/>

I hear the taconite plants spilling their waste<br/>
the trains pulling their heavy loads.<br/>

Minntac.<br/>

In the pit, giant dump trucks<br/>
haul tons of rock to the Crusher.<br/>

Laborers in the Agglomerator<br/>
breathe black dust.<br/>

The furnace vents fill with hot pellets<br/>
have to be emptied into the buckets<br/>

wearing asbestos suits.<br/>

White pellets were 1000 degrees Fahrenheit<br/>
black were 400 degrees,<br/>
Pellets could stick to the skin, burn into the neck.<br/>
It was called a Minntac brand.<br/>

One day, I saw a front-end loader<br/>

On the thawing ground, I found<br/>
a robin’s nest,<br/>
a coil of mud and dry grass<br/>
woven around a single chamber.<br/>
</p><p>
I’ve worked like this<br/>
for the same result<br/>
something of my own disappearing.<br/>
</p><p>
My own child, grown and flown.<br/>
My old houses, abandoned,<br/>
the love sputtered out.<br/>
</p><p>
Every year, I enter the forest<br/>
and pick up broken shells<br/>
or the skull of a deer.<br/>
And now this, a drab and hollow nest.<br/>
</p><p>
When the robins return, they will build<br/>
a new work of art<br/>
only to be discarded again.<br/>
They will march across the yard and guard<br/>
</p><p>
that space. Will sing.<br/>
I must put it on my sill, to remember<br/>
in next year’s unfamiliar spring:<br/>
how empty is the natal place.<br/>

Before the earth, in the Kalevala,<br/>
a virgin of the air Ilmatar<br/>
wandered the high altitudes<br/>
with time on her hands.<br/>
</p><p>
The ocean lured her in.<br/>
She slapped the water, flirted<br/>
with wind and the wind dared<br/>
or the waves slid along her thighs<br/>
quickened in her empty womb —<br/>
</p><p>
she swam seven hundred years<br/>
with salt upon her tongue.<br/>
In solitude. A child within.<br/>
</p><p>
She heard a lonesome note in the sky,<br/>
some winged thing<br/>
searching for a land to build a nest.<br/>
In reply, lifted her knee, an island.<br/>
The hen came to nest<br/>
laid seven eggs. One was iron.<br/>
</p><p>
The hen set to brooding.<br/>
The nest so hot<br/>
Ilmatar in the indigo deep<br/>
couldn’t keep still<br/>
twitched like an earthquake<br/>
and the eggs all broke.<br/>
</p><p>
One half shell formed dry earth<br/>
Terra, and the other half<br/>
the aqua vault.<br/>
One yolk became sun<br/>
and albumen, clouds<br/>
and the Milky Way.<br/>
</p><p>
The litter of shells<br/>
veins of iron and copper.<br/>
Ilmatar moved clay<br/>
beneath her feet to make reefs<br/>
and deeps for a silver cloud of herring<br/>
and icebergs calving.<br/>
</p><p>
Made the headlands<br/>
and mountains to hold up the sky<br/>
Unfolded the continents<br/>
drew out the rivers.<br/>
</p><p>
This is how Ilmatar’s labor began.<br/>
Exertion became a waterfall.<br/>
From her moon’s chamber<br/>
through the bony gate<br/>
she gave birth to a singer,<br/>
an earth diver.<br/>
</p><p>
Named him Väinämöinen.<br/>
Already he was an old man.<br/>
</p><p>
^<br/>
Winds rippled through grain fields<br/>
and swayed the dense forests.<br/>
</p><p>
The singer plucked at strands<br/>
on the jawbone of a fish,<br/>
hän lauloi laulun.<br/>
Laulaa taivanrannalle,<br/>
to sing to the sky’s beach.<br/>
</p><p>
Loud migrations darkened the sky.<br/>
</p><p>
In the waves were multitudes.<br/>

Radio signals wandered. The road a dark avenue north<br/>
through Seven Mile Swamp and the crossings of deer.<br/>
Our union went by land and water, under the stars, our truck<br/>
pulling a boat and motor in a blizzard of moths.<br/>
</p><p>
To live by the mine and not mine. To store, not excavate.<br/>
In the winter, to hunt rabbits and partridge,<br/>
leap and burst and flight.<br/>
To climb into the stand for the annual buck.<br/>
See how the body smooths the rough bark of the tree.<br/>
</p><p>
To hunt moose. Gut and quarter the body. Fry moose liver<br/>
in a cast iron pan, in onions. Sew a jacket from its hide<br/>
on a shoemaker’s treadle machine. Trim the hood<br/>
with wolfskin and line it with goose down.<br/>
</p><p>
To form a small country, population two.<br/>
Carry water. Between killing frosts, plant flats of tomatoes<br/>
and can rows of red innards, tomato hearts<br/>
in wide-mouthed jars. Rows of deer meat, in gravy,<br/>
sealed in a pressure cooker.<br/>
</p><p>
To pick berries. Chop wood. Ignore the years between us.<br/>
In the spring opener, accustom ourselves to the rocking<br/>
of the boat in wave after wave. To anchor in the cold,<br/>
holding lines. At New Year’s, turn a hand augur<br/>
and make a hole in the ice.<br/>
</p><p>
To jig for lake trout in a polar vortex,<br/>
the day bright with sundogs. Camp on the ice.<br/>
Warm our tent with a stove. Bale water from the floor.<br/>
To sleep at forty below zero. Hear the lake making ice,<br/>
a sound like thunder, except from beneath.<br/>
</p><p>
To find our melting point. Our boiling point.<br/>
To smoke trout. Wrap in butcher paper.<br/>
Set a table with the prize fish<br/>
served with cream cheese and slices of cucumber.<br/>
Drink vodka. Heat the pie in an iron<br/>
in the wood stove and eat.<br/>
</p><p>
Anything could be fixed, a propeller caught in the weeds,<br/>
the boat grounded on a reef or a broken leg.<br/>
Staples worked themselves through the skin after many years.<br/>
He moved the course of a small river. A forest was making<br/>
and unmaking.<br/>
</p><p>
We measured the old pines, built a house and dock<br/>
in another country. Made a child.<br/>
I can’t own this, not even the words.<br/>
In May, my mother tied a scarf at her nape<br/>
and played a game of chance. Didn’t win.<br/>
</p><p>
Life runs on whim and temper.<br/>
On this red morning, through sweeping balsam<br/>
comes the deer to the bird feeder.<br/>
The sunflowers grew fast and spent their seeds.<br/>
Our stake melted like snow. We thought it would last,<br/>
but Canadian geese contradicted us flying overhead.

I kneel on red stones,<br/>
on skulls and broken bones.<br/>

A swan, distant witness,<br/>

My eyes see what is underneath<br/>

I take him back not into my body<br/>
that conceived, received, and raised this one<br/>

I turn the edges, commend to God.<br/>

In the palaces of wilderness,<br/>
come to a small table.<br/>
Bird wings, above the open crowns of pines<br/>
in motion.<br/>
Below, wind only a breath<br/>
easy to mistake for your own.<br/>
Near are hidden movements of deer<br/>
or if not there,<br/>
then wolf and moose, or rabbit and lynx<br/>
the unlimited and narrow paths —<br/>
long streams in a boreal ocean.<br/>
Their lives are secret<br/>
and you in their lair. Listen with your eyes.<br/>
Sunlight comes between shadows.<br/>
Lingonberries drop down a digestive tract.<br/>
Here on the moss, sammal,<br/>
everything diminishes. Mushrooms.<br/>
Kanttarellit.<br/>
For every death<br/>
waits a kingdom of insects<br/>
and cups filled with rain.<br/>

Not driving but falling through the night,<br/>

in the shine of headlights, tiny meteors or stars,<br/>

Upward, I was taken.<br/>

my brown shoes under the table.<br/>

On stage, the poet performed in blue shoes<br/>
with a raspberry and white wave<br/>
on the edge of each of his soles.<br/>

Applauding —<br/>
I could never wear shoes like that<br/>
but then, I can hardly wear any.<br/>

tight-fitting, sleek, flexible.<br/>
On this trip, I brought just one pair, a mistake.<br/>
</p><p>
My feet are hot, they need to change a lot,<br/>
require air. They ache. The arches need stroking.<br/>
My heels want to go.<br/>

I might find kengät.<br/>
But like so often, I’d sit on the bed<br/>

My feet swell. Maybe I need<br/>

Attitude. Size. Speed.<br/>

Summer on the river in Zim<br/>
beneath the bridge.<br/>
Three girls swam in the currents.<br/>
We left our towels<br/>
on the steep bank, in the long grass.<br/>
The water, dark as amber<br/>
or tea. It was cold. Spring fed.<br/>
We could cross from one side<br/>
to the other. We could<br/>
step in the drop off, not drown.<br/>
Cows grazing upon the ridge<br/>
kept an eye on us.<br/>
Then a bell rang and they went<br/>
across the field into the barn<br/>
which used to be the Woullet house.<br/>
The cows were in the old kitchen.<br/>
We never knew the Woullets —<br/>
didn’t know the past at all<br/>
although it cast us out of its door.<br/>
Now hooves scraped<br/>
floors once washed clean.<br/>
Manure was piled high<br/>
outside the door<br/>
beside yellow dandelions.<br/>
The cows chewed their cud<br/>
and looked out the windows<br/>
at the evening light,<br/>
while my uncle tied their tails<br/>
with binder twine before milking.<br/>
We salted our toes<br/>
to make the blood-suckers let go.<br/>
We put our shoes back on wet feet<br/>
to walk over the new mown hay.<br/>
We climbed over the log gate<br/>
and ran toward a new house.<br/>
I’ve come to know that freedom now<br/>
it winds across the landscape<br/>
calling like girls’ voices.<br/>

The dock upon the night waters<br/>
led to a violet sky.<br/>
We went in the gray fishing boat and motor<br/>
on the old route, my son and I.<br/>
</p><p>
I did not think I’d return this way<br/>
after thirty years.<br/>
I was a sapling and now an old willow.<br/>
What was once a field of dandelions<br/>
is now a dark forest.<br/>
</p><p>
A ghost shadowed my steps. I saw him in my son<br/>
who went to swim and catch fish.<br/>
I saw him in the woodstove where a fallen bird<br/>
had burned, trying to fly.<br/>
</p><p>
I found large stones and a granite face.<br/>
Pine trees grown fifty feet.<br/>
Cedars thick and green. I did not sleep.<br/>
Footings had sunk.<br/>
The stream must have fallen undergound.<br/>
</p><p>
A story I’d started had been taken over by others.<br/>
Reading their words<br/>
helped me see past my own death.<br/>
What seemed immovable was shifting.<br/>
Stacks of boards. Fishing tackle on the tables.<br/>
Ceaseless accumulation.<br/>
</p><p>
Lucky, I say, to cross over<br/>
and see new grandchildren on the slope.<br/>
To smell sun in their hair.<br/>
To give this all away.<br/>

The water lapped on shore<br/>
and loons called in the night.<br/>
A bear walked by unseen but left its mark.<br/>

the clerk dropped change in our palms<br/>
and we split the Sacajawea coins.<br/>
Two women, two dollars each.<br/>
Liberty was emblazoned over her head<br/>
and on her left shoulder In God We Trust<br/>
and on the flipside, an eagle flying.<br/>
The coins clicked in our pockets<br/>
as we opened the door of our room.<br/>
It was fortuitous, this goddess<br/>
bringing us through the wilderness<br/>

daylight fell on the mountains and valleys<br/>
of the sheets<br/>
and the sound track played “A Case of You.”<br/>
It was a cold March<br/>
and we were behind glass<br/>
looking out to Lake Superior<br/>
steam rising from the hot tub.<br/>
We fed each other slices of oranges<br/>
and focaccia pierced by<br/>
small arrows of rosemary.<br/>
The flying-by clouds propelled the wind<br/>
that circled the earth and came back again.<br/>
We were in a river that could not stop.<br/>
I rubbed the coins for luck<br/>
and the woman whose face I touched<br/>
led us onward,<br/>
explorers of the light,<br/>
not taking land<br/>
not trading in counterfeits.<br/>
We came up for breath on the river delta.<br/>
This was not luck but legal tender.<br/>

of brown and silver walleyes.<br/>
The shore’s edge a mix of tenses<br/>
and mosquitoes chased by dragonflies.<br/>
Ducks swim over the wakes<br/>
of loons’ landings. Time’s<br/>
concentric circles widen,<br/>
the forgotten, the remembered<br/>

Over my head, the slow flap of a heron<br/>
a flock of starlings.<br/>

I was born in two languages, born of two families who came from western Finland across the Baltic and Atlantic to settle in Minnesota. My grandparents’ language, my parents’ first language, became waves. Their words sank beneath the surface as I entered my adult life, but the music of the language flowed in me, rhythms that did not fit into English.
</p><p>
The Finnish language is imagistic and close to nature. Taivaanranta is one of the words for horizon. It translates to sky’s beach. Finnish requires a different placement of the tongue and a different way to hold the mouth. In Finnish the word for lake is järvi. The <i>j</i> is pronounced as <i>y</i> in English. The diacritic mark on the <i>a</i> indicates a short vowel sound, like in the word <i>hand</i>. An <i>r</i> is always rolled. The <i>i</i> is pronounced as a long <i>e</i>. Finnish uses noun endings instead of prepositional phrases to indicate position. For example, the word <i>vene</i> (which means boat) undergoes numerous transformations, like most Finnish words, in the process of telling a story. Consonant changes, vowel harmonies, and harmonic word endings reach a dimension of melody.
</p><p>
^<br/>
In northern Minnesota, I steady the vessel as I paddle across each lake. Home from kayaking a while ago, I noticed a black spot in the upper corner of my vision, sort of like a tadpole in my left eye. In brightly lit rooms, hardly noticeable. When I walked into a darkened room, the spot flipped over. I noticed more floaters, a long black fiber which was like a bit of grass or spider’s web located between my eye and the objects which I could see, revealing a third dimension that I had not realized existed.
</p><p>
Two days later, the doctor who examined me concluded it was a posterior vitreous detachment. What I was seeing, he explained, is called flashing. He added that it might change and move to the center of my vision because the vitreous continues to shift. He went on talking about the anatomy of the eye. It won’t go away, but you’ll get used to it, he said. Appalled, I looked at him through the speckled surface of my vision.
</p><p>
When one buys a blue boat, it seems one sees a lot of blue boats. It could be synchronicity in the universe, or it’s a habit of the mind. A manuscript of poems is like a lake and stays fluid for a long time. But then, lakes turn over. My subject is the three-way continental divide in northern Minnesota. Watersheds travel to the Great Lakes, the Mississippi, and Hudson Bay. It’s about rivers: surface, underwater, and underground.
</p><p>
Thomas F. Waters, author of the nonfiction book <i>The Free-Flowing River</i>, says rivers are erosional landscapes. As a river flows forward in a valley and carves itself deeper, the valley travels backward. There are bends or turns. A stream’s structure is an array of patches, a patch mosaic. The pieces of the mosaic are large and small; these include the headwaters, midstream flows or a riffle over a moss-covered stone. Always, rivers are lines of energy.
</p><p>
The subject is surface displacements, the excavations in the landscape where I grew up. And in water, volume displacing other volumes. The Mesabi Iron Range, where I grew up, is an area 3 miles wide and 120 miles long, an erosional landscape and an industrial one. According to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, 4.1 billion tons of ore and taconite have been shipped away. Already mining has permanently altered the three-way divide and the path of flowing water.
</p><p>
Surface displacements also refers to migration. Tribal nations have lived here for centuries, but as the United States population grew and settlers moved west, the tribes were pushed west as well. The Ashininaabe came to Minnesota, and with them, the vision of food that grows on water, wild rice or Manoomin. Minnesota owns 24 percent of the mineral rights in the state, but the rest is owned by private parties, primarily mining corporations (Mesabi Metallics, Keetac, Cleveland Cliffs, and others). This means mining gets priority above all else. Buildings are demolished as an open pit expands. If towns are in the way, they are removed. Highways are taken out and rerouted. People are displaced. This is where my grandparents arrived in the early 1900s along with so many other immigrants. According to the Minnesota Historical Society, over 40 languages were spoken. The only other region as ethnically diverse at the time was New York City.
</p><p>
^<br/>
I worked as a maintenance laborer at Minntac in Mountain Iron, a summer job when I was in college. It was 1975. The pay was good. I was in the Agglomerator where four monstrous furnaces rolled taconite fines and bentonite into pellets. All the equipment in the taconite plant is larger than the human scale. Each furnace was the size of a train engine and as noisy. Laborers wore earplugs and other safety equipment like hard hats, goggles, and steel-toed boots. I was in an alienated workforce, about to go out on a wildcat strike, unauthorized by the union. The owners of the plant lived somewhere on the East Coast. Steel imports were coming into the United States for the first time, increasing the competition and driving down the price, and the workforce didn’t fully understand what that meant. Within a few weeks, the strike was broken. The corporation sued the employees for lost profits, and the workers gave in and returned to the plant without having made any gains.
</p><p>
The job was hard, boring, and hazardous. Most shifts, I aimed a high-pressure water hose at the taconite pellets that had fallen off the conveyors to the floor of the plant. By washing down the floor, we were able to prevent a build-up that could stop the conveyor from functioning. Sometimes, there were extra chores like doing maintenance on the furnaces. When they were shut down, and after they had spent some days cooling, we would push wheelbarrows inside the furnace and shovel out broken bricks. Other times, on the floor of the plant, we emptied hot pellets from the vent pipes from the furnaces. Red pellets, like live coals, were 1000 degrees, and black pellets, 400 degrees. The vents weren’t supposed to accumulate hot pellets, but they did. We had asbestos suits and gloves for the task. We opened the door of the vent and let the pellets fall out into the bucket of a front-end loader, which would turn and dump them onto a conveyor going out to the loading dock. My coworkers suggested always wearing a bandanna around the neck to avoid the stray pellets raining down through the catwalks on the upper floors. If they fell into the collar of one’s coveralls, they would stick in the flesh and cause a “Minntac brand.”
</p><p>
The dust in the mine enters the lungs. Taconite fibers are similar to asbestos fibers. Employees of the taconite mine run a risk of contracting mesothelioma. When Meridel LeSeuer was writing, radium was thought to be a miraculous element. It was used in cancer treatment, cosmetics, toothpaste, and painted on watch dials. Only later was it determined to be carcinogenic. Unfortunately, risks are usually discovered after exposures to substances, elements, or chemicals.
</p><p>
We were submerged. The Agglomerator had no windows. Laborers toiled in an industrial spume. The paperback books I tucked in my lunch pail curled up stiff as fallen leaves, darkened by heat and whatever was in the air. After every shift, I showered in the “dry” and though I’d soaped and rinsed thoroughly, I toweled taconite dust from my nostrils and the folds of my ears and behind my knees. Grease and dust stained my coveralls and my underwear. Once the whistle blew ending the shift, men drove to the bars and poured beer down their throats. They blacked out, and in oblivion, after the bars closed, drove erratically down sideroads to one of the many lakes, chains of lakes, or to the sinuous St Louis River. Some went skinny-dipping, some hooked up with partners they couldn’t fully see, and some collided with unmovable objects. Off-limits were the tailings ponds and the abandoned mine pits, steep-walled and filled with ice-cold water and unknown hazards.
</p><p>
The abandoned open pits suffer “water gain” because of underground water and rain. Pumps must be kept running to keep the excavation from flooding. In 2019, after a heavy rain, the embankment broke between the old Hector mine pit and the Embarrass River and water tore a ravine 50 feet wide and 25 feet deep. A burnt orange torrent, the color of iron oxidation, poured into the river and went downstream into the Embarrass Lake, Cedar Island Lake, and Lake Esquagama. Even before this, the lakes and rivers had been proven to have high sulfate levels which largely comes from taconite mines, as there are high levels of the compound in discharge from waste storage. This spill made things worse. Sulfates cause wild rice or Manoomin, to die, eliminating this important source of nutrition and sustenance.
</p><p>
On the east side of the Iron Range stretches the Boundary Waters Canoe Area, a wilderness designated by the federal government, recently the center of controversy. Some want to develop copper sulfide mining despite the fact that surface storage of waste rock, tailings and sulfide-bearing ore creates acid, heavy metals, and sulfates that seep into groundwater and contaminate lakes, streams and rivers. In this region with a three-way continental divide, all forms of life are at risk of loss and displacement.
</p><p>
^<br/>
There’s so much weight. There are unknowns, and there are known things deliberately disregarded or dismissed. Events in the past, union-busting, strikes, sabotage, and murders are hidden under a shroud of silence. I’ve read data about mining accidents and environmental contamination and rates of alcoholism and violence. News and stories tell of industrial accidents and the effects of contact with hazardous substances. In the archives, each day’s newsprint demonstrates the blindness people have going forward into the future.
</p><p>
History documents that the treaties made with the tribal nations were not followed, and yet silences have obscured the facts. Eminent domain has been used and misused against tribal land and later against settlers in Minnesota who buy land but not the mineral rights beneath its surface. The maps are redrawn when roads and communities are demolished and the landscape is excavated. Every corporation seeks to maximize profit. Against the size of large-scale mining operations, people’s lives begin to diminish.
</p><p>
As iron ore was depleted, underground mines became open-pit mines. Technological developments allowed the industry to use lower-grade ore to make taconite. Now, the mine dumps are consumed in what is called scram mining, furthering the metamorphosis of the landscape. When I drive along Highway 169, I see yard signs with the words: “We Support Mining, Mining Supports Us.” I know, and they know, it’s always been a story of boom and bust.
</p><p>
^<br/>
Under the surface are hidden worlds. Things float away. Politics and disasters seem even more fluid these days, but I think this has always been true. Polarization has a wave pattern. When waves coming into shore bounce back: reflection. Waves that slow down and change direction: refraction. When waves affect each other: interference, which can be positive or resonant or can be negative or destructive. When waves bend: diffraction, which has shadow zones. A disturbance in one place causes disturbances in other places. One can’t escape this fact, no matter where one looks.
</p><p>
The experimental poet Rosemarie Waldrop wrote: “When eye and mind are interrupted in their travel, a vertical dimension opens out from the horizontal lines. Suddenly we’re reading an orchestral score....No longer one single voice.” The task is to bring together things conflicting, noisy, transcendent, and dystopian. Perhaps we need a new habit of mind, not just to focus on synchronicity but also disruption and dissonance, to look below the surface and look deeper.
</p><p>
^<br/>
Water and language are fluid and ever-changing. As we were bringing the boats to Stewart Lake, a helicopter with a red bucket lifted over the trees and went north, carrying water to the Greenwood wildfire covering nearly 40 square miles. Beyond, in the Boundary Waters, were two more fires, the John Ek fire and Whelp Fire. Smoke caused a haze in the air. I was in my blue kayak and my paddling partner in her red one. The water level at Stewart Lake was low. We approached our landmark rock. The boulder sat much higher above the surface than usual, just like the islands. The wind was intense. We went along the east side and then returned to shore as another helicopter with a red bucket flew north. The floater in my vision seemed like a spider web or a taconite fiber. My eyes were irritated and red from the smoke. The red bucket under the helicopter had the same orb shape of an eye, and it was filled with sloshing water. The image seems to be expanding and contracting because of my altered vision, the way that things at the bottom can magnify and shrink while looking underwater.
</p><p>
^<br/>
Every letter is pronounced in Finnish, none are silent. Double consonants are each pronounced, elongating the sound as if it were a note held long, like a dotted quarter note, the dot indicating the need to hold the sound half again as long. At the time, it was winter. In the woods, snow had fallen on the roof of my small house and curved over the eaves reaching for the drifts. It felt like my grandmother’s house when I was a child and awoke to the pendulum clock striking each hour in the night. Moonlight rained on the white roads, laden branches of spruce and balsam, mounds of snow. Through the windows, moonlight filled the room, making everything float. A moment like a photograph. The Finnish word hetkessä means a moment. It means <i>in next to no time</i>.
</p><p>
The darkest place on the Iron Range is the deepest place, the underground mine in Soudan. At Level 27, it is 2,341 feet deep. Along the shaft of the mine are stopes. It’s a park now, and people can buy a ticket to take the elevator down to the bottom for a tour. The underground mine is so dark I can’t see my hand in front of my face. The mine is so dark that a physics lab was temporarily created there to study dark matter, things in the universe that cannot be seen at all, but that are known because of their interaction with gravity. Neutrinos were shot from the Fermi lab near Chicago through the earth and recorded by several tons of specialized equipment down in the mine shaft. The absolute darkness in the mine avoided a skew caused by protons in the research results. According to CERN (The European Council for Nuclear Research), dark matter outweighs visible matter roughly six to one. It travels in next to no time.
</p><p>
^<br/>
I want a new habit of mind to note the invisible. When I walk in the forest, summer or winter, I rarely see wild things, only tracks and traces of slow ramblings and sudden chases. Poetry also has tracks and traces of the invisible or hidden. Poetry holds a negative space that is not silence exactly. It can mark the disappearance of land and old languages, mark the loss of trees and bodies of water, and trace the paths and reasons for arrivals and departures.

	<h1>Notes <span class="top"><a href="#sectiontoc" title="back to contents" alt="back to table of contents">&uarr;</a></span></h1>
</header><h5>I. In the Water</h5>
<p>
“Water-Filled Mine Pit” is an ekphrastic prose poem for the “Mine Songs” music and video created by Sara Pajunen. The poem was also inspired by poet and journalist Meridel LeSueur: “Let yourself down, as if underwater, into these lost walls, to hunt for treasure, to illuminate violence with meaning. Under sea-strange light these little houses glimmer in memory, powerful as radium.”
</p>
<h5>II. Surface Displacements</h5>
<p>
The epigraph by Lorine Niedecker is from her poem, “(L.Z.),” which originated from a correspondence with poet Louis Zukofsky.
</p><p>
Three Rivers and the “Surface Displacements” poem refer to the three-way continental divide located in Hibbing, Minnesota, on the Mesabi Iron Range. The watersheds and rivers travel into the Great Lakes, the Mississippi River, and Hudson Bay.
</p><p>
The Hill of Three Waters or the Triple Divide is designated on a historical marker at the edge of the Hull-Rust Mahoning mine pit. According to the Historical Marker Database (<a href="www.hmdb.org">www.hmdb.org</a>):
</p><p>
<blockquote>
A triple point, or triple divide, is the place where two continental divides intersect and water drains into three different watersheds. There are five such places in the United States. In Minnesota, the Northern Divide intersects the St. Lawrence Seaway Divide. From this point, water flows in three directions, north to Hudson Bay, south to the Gulf of Mexico, and east to the Gulf of St. Lawrence. This area was called the Hill of Three Waters by the Chippewa, and its location is 47° 26.863′ N, 92° 56.8′ W. The marker is near Hibbing, Minnesota, in St. Louis County. The Chippewa Indians referred to the location as “The Hill of Three Waters” or “The Top of the World” and frequently held their council meetings there for tribes living within about a 100-mile radius. The site is not publicly accessible due to mining operations. Its official platting is Section 26, Township 58, Range 21.
</blockquote>
</p><p>
The Historical Marker Database is a catalog of public history cast in metal, carved on stone, or embedded in resin. The database is maintained by volunteers who invite people to send in photographs and links related to historical markers.
</p><p>
A second historical marker is placed nearby this one at The Hull-Rust Mahoning Mine Pit Overlook. Here, the marker notes that mining began in 1895 and this mine pit was once known as the largest open pit mine in the world. Its maximum depth was 600 feet in the Scranton Pit. By 2000, nearly 2 billion tons of iron ore and waste were removed. Both sources note this information is provided in partnership with the Cleveland-Cliffs Foundation. Cleveland-Cliffs is a mining corporation.
</p><p>
“A river catches herself as she is falling” is inspired by the mystic Mechthild von Magdeburg (1207–1282), a Beguine.
</p><p>
“In the city are those who cannot be traced...” is an ekphrastic poem for visual art by Cecilia Ramón. The poem refers to Argentina’s Dirty War (in Spanish, Guerra Sucia), also called Process of National Reorganization, Spanish Proceso de Reorganización Nacional or El Proceso. As many as 30,000 people were killed or disappeared.
</p><p>
“In their wake, the undocumented...” refers to immigrants who are stowaways inside the hold of planes and ships and those that risk perilous passage over water. The phrase also refers to those who are brought across the borders in secret, inside closed freight trucks and vans.
</p>
<h5>III. Three Rivers</h5>
<p>
In the prose poem “Soliloquy,” the sentence <i>I realize the way my eyes deceive me</i> echoes a line from the country song “Paper Roses,” written and composed by Fred Spielman and Janice Torre. Loretta Lynn and several other country singers have performed and recorded it.
</p><p>
“Dialectics” is a cento. The italicized phrases are taken from Hegel and Marx whose writings are now available in the public domain.
</p><p>
“Broken Shell” is a retelling of the creation story in the epic poem of Finland, the Kalevala, that was performed by traveling minstrels or singers prior to being written down by Elias Lönnrot. Some of the runos, or poems, have never been in print. Beside creation stories, it has magic charms, laments, advice, stories, and adventures.
</p>
<h5>VI. Otherworld</h5>
<p>
The Finnish language poems were written while I was at Arteles in Hämeenkyrö, Finland at the Enter Text residency.
</p><p>
According to Veikko Anttonen in <i>Mythic Discourses</i>, in the Kalevala, Pohjola refers to the Otherworld and “can take the form of Pohjola (the northland), the womb, a burial ground, a forest, a grave, Tuonela or Manala (underworld or realm of the dead), a strange village or country.” He also writes: 
</p><p>
<blockquote>
In [Finnish and Uralic] folk narratives, Pohjola is described as a mythic island in the primeval sea, surrounded by open waters. In addition Pohjola is separated from the world of the living by the River of Pohjola, the River of Tuonela, the chasm of Manala, the age-old brook of Manala. The River of Tuonela is the boundary between this world and the other, where everything is reversed in relation to the world of the living.
</blockquote>
</p><p>
“Viisitoista Runo / Poem 15” is a story about a woman who brings her son back to life from the river of death. Askeli Gallen-Kallela’s painting, <i>Lemminkäinen Äiti</i>, vividly depicts the story. Lemminkäinen is an adventure-loving braggart and mythic hero in the Kalevala.
</p><p>
“Kuppi Jäkälä / Cup Lichen” is inspired by a poem of the same title by Helvi Juvonen (1919–1959). She was a Finnish writer and recipient of the Eino Leino Prize in 1957.
</p>
<h5>V. Headwaters</h5>
<p>
The poem “Ghazal: Without Sinking” refers to the music of Hildur Guðnadóttir, an Icelandic composer and cellist.
</p>
<h5>VI. Displacements</h5>
<p>
Thomas F. Waters writes:
<blockquote>
Landmasses that include streams and rivers — what we may call valleys or watersheds — constitute terrains known as “erosional landscapes.” The erosion of rock and land sediments is a process that moves the materials of the high plains and mountains to the sea, while at the same time the eroding process moves headward, causing river valleys to migrate upstream.
</blockquote>
</p><p>
In 2022, the Biden administration cancelled two federal mineral leases held by Twin Metals Minnesota. This is still a controversial topic in Minnesota’s public discourse.

</p><p>
More detail and an explanation of the Cold Dark Matter Search experiment (CDMSII) conducted by CERN (The European Council for Nuclear Research) is found in the <i>CERN Courier</i> magazine and website. The study is complete and the equipment has been removed from the Soudan mine.
