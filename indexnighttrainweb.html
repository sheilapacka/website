	<h1>In Gratitude <span class="top"><a href="#sectiontoc" title="back to contents" alt="back to table of contents">&uarr;</a></span></h1>
</header><p>
Thank you to the community of writers and artists in the Northeast Minnesota
region, especially Pamela Mittlefehldt and Gary Boelhower. Thank you to Kathy
McTavish for music, art, passion, and inspiration. This project was made possible
through a fiscal year 2012–2013 McKnight/ACHF/ARAC Individual Artist
Fellowship Grant from the Arrowhead Regional Arts Council (www.aracouncil.
org) which is funded in part with money from the Minnesota Arts and Cultural
Heritage Fund as appropriated by the Minnesota State Legislature with money
from the vote of the people of Minnesota on November 4, 2008 and the McKnight
Foundation. This book is dedicated to my paternal grandparents Jacob
Packa and Helen Konsteri Packa and my maternal grandparents, Nellie Mariana
Palo Kamunen and Nikolai Oskar Kamunen.

I excavate these words from a vein of iron<br/>
from stones broken<br/>
beneath old growth<br/>
from the open pit — lit by dynamite<br/>
by men whose lives are punctuated by midnights<br/>
who drive new cars to the plant,<br/>
the Crusher and Agglomerator,<br/>
and later suffer mesothelioma.<br/>
I drive in acid rain<br/>
my compass gone awry<br/>
over Proterozoic layers with four wheel drive<br/>
aware of reverse polarity.<br/>
These words are test drills and core samples<br/>
from the Boundary Waters<br/>
these words wrung from the whistles<br/>
and wheels that turn<br/>
and have never projected into board rooms.<br/>
I have yet to wield these powers or capitalize<br/>
see the returns.<br/>
I claim my words from the broken<br/>
English, damaged roots,<br/>
Finnish syntax, and geomagnetic fields<br/>
from Eminent Domain<br/>
small print, unreadable clauses.<br/>
I find my vowels<br/>
from labor contracts and mine dumps<br/>
factories and invisible contamination.<br/>
My words, in the run off<br/>
in open streams — oxidize<br/>
form like tree rings<br/>
in industrial circles<br/>
heat in the smelters, pour like lava into steel<br/>
form these rails that carry the trains<br/>
these trains that carry this freight.<br/>

	<h1>Strange Highway <span class="top"><a href="#sectiontoc" title="back to contents" alt="back to table of contents">&uarr;</a></span></h1>
</header><p>
I was born on the highway<br/>
that paved over the feet<br/>
of the first peoples<br/>
with the weight of gold<br/>
over the hopes of prospectors<br/>
and diamond drillers<br/>
cobbled by the hooves<br/>
of oxen and horses<br/>
pressed with macadam<br/>
bitter with tar and feathers.<br/>
I travelled with the magnetic pull<br/>
of iron around river<br/>
now reservoir now pit<br/>
fell on the frozen ground<br/>
where horses and carts carried out logs<br/>
and carried in steam-shovels<br/>
on the Vermilion Trail<br/>
that boiled the frost in spring<br/>
sunk axles<br/>
of the brothers and capitalists<br/>
those who gazed<br/>
at the ground as they walked<br/>
extracted the ore<br/>
to develop this continent<br/>
made the ships that carried the iron<br/>
to the steel mills<br/>
built the bridges<br/>
filled the cities with skyscrapers<br/>
and smoke<br/>
fed the assembly lines of cars<br/>
and made the munitions<br/>
that won the war.<br/>
I slept in this traffic<br/>
dreamed like immigrants<br/>
dreaming of home —<br/>
breathed the dust of the mine<br/>
heard the whistles and the dump cars<br/>
pulling three billion tons<br/>
of iron from the ground beneath our feet<br/>
heard the sirens that staved the deaths<br/>
of wounded workmen<br/>
wiped the sweat with a dirty bandanna<br/>
waited in the waiting rooms<br/>
of Emergency<br/>
read the news of the economy.<br/>
I saved what I could<br/>
followed the Laurentian Divide<br/>
joined the union<br/>
drank the booze<br/>
followed the sun<br/>
that rose and set upon the waters<br/>
where I swam<br/>
lulled by forty languages<br/>
and blessed<br/>
the hands that did the work<br/>
strung the ground wires<br/>
directed the lightning down to stone.<br/>
I drove the miles of this highway<br/>
swerved in cars along its curves<br/>
crashed into barriers<br/>
buried the mean and sweet<br/>
claimed my life<br/>
from its careless abandon<br/>
lost those acres but not the hole<br/>
grown ever larger<br/>
walked upon the overburden<br/>
broken tracks and cracks and erosions<br/>
and patches<br/>
felt the hum of wheels turning<br/>
the speed that has taken the lives<br/>
of those who hesitate or not<br/>
like the river with its efuence<br/>
like the wind with its residue<br/>
from the stacks<br/>
like the currents with their tailings<br/>
that turn back and forth<br/>
settling this earth.<br/>

I work as a miner<br/>
in the old ways<br/>
empty the buckets<br/>
hauled by pulleys on oiled cables<br/>
loads of broken shale<br/>
water and compressed<br/>
blades of grass<br/>
accordions and old dogs.<br/>
In the factory of the past<br/>
steam whistles<br/>
start and stop the shifs.<br/>
Here is a wheel turning<br/>
with a sorrowful, mechanical limp.<br/>
I nod to foremen and bosses<br/>
and beneath, to dirt smeared faces<br/>
of men in work boots heavy with clay.<br/>
Tese lives are shaped by notes<br/>
in the dark underground<br/>
jammed into coal for the furnaces<br/>
by the frictions of boom and bust.<br/>
We use everything until it’s gone.<br/>
In these old offices, typewriters race.<br/>
The freighters come to port<br/>
hungry for the trains.<br/>
The engines purr under the ore docks<br/>
hatches open for taconite<br/>
and the dump cars dump<br/>
as the propellers churn<br/>
in the turbid water below the surface<br/>
where rain can’t beat.<br/>

	<h1>North Star <span class="top"><a href="#sectiontoc" title="back to contents" alt="back to table of contents">&uarr;</a></span></h1>
</header><p>
In Hanko, Finland<br/>
a young woman boards<br/>
the vessel in the Baltic<br/>
for a ship across the Atlantic.<br/>
The North Star shines in the sky.<br/>
She’s carrying in her valise<br/>
a change of clothes<br/>
a packet of seeds<br/>
and the sauna dipper.<br/>
Distance pours between constellations<br/>
between English words on her tongue<br/>
through storms and sun.<br/>
In New York City, she buys<br/>
a one way ticket<br/>
boards the train going<br/>
across the continent<br/>
arrives on an inland sea.<br/>
The winter ground underfoot<br/>
is familiar with frost<br/>
as she transfers to a northbound<br/>
along the Vermilion Trail<br/>
in Minnesota.<br/>
Ahead of her waits a man<br/>
a house to be built<br/>
and a fire that burns it down.<br/>
Ahead, eleven children<br/>
to bear, a few she must bury,<br/>
the cows in the barn<br/>
needing to be milked.<br/>
Unbroken ground only hers to till.<br/>
Above her, the North Star<br/>
inside the aurora borealis, northern<br/>
banners waving welcome —<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Two Timing<br/>
<br/>
In the old house, a clock.<br/>
With each swing of the pendulum, a life span<br/>
crossed in less than a minute. A flash of brass<br/>
and hidden, a winding key.<br/>
I have swung across the floor to music<br/>
hand to hand, rough.<br/>
Passed a flask, laughed.<br/>
Marked the quarter hour, counted night hours<br/>
under the moon in an iron bed<br/>
slung low to the floor.<br/>
Opened the door, closed the glass.<br/>
In the crimson heart, a chamber<br/>
at arm’s reach.<br/>
From room to room I fling the dark<br/>
myself in it.<br/>
Beginning, ending,<br/>
too far, not far enough.<br/>

Beneath the ramp, silver<br/>
muscled light follows<br/>
hidden lines of navigation.<br/>
Sky and sea unlatch,<br/>
turn back to back.<br/>
Without breath or mist,<br/>
not a sigh of wind<br/>
stirs earthward. Why, you ask?<br/>
A pearl is grown by irritation.<br/>
Yesterday, it was difficult to row.<br/>
Wind filled banners, rifled the water<br/>
shifted small stones below.<br/>
For a while, knots the sailors tied<br/>
to cleats held firm.<br/>
After that, lank went taut and<br/>
the bolts let go.<br/>
Deck hands put out the lamps.<br/>
Winds moved beneath the surface<br/>
in rhyme, forward and reverse.<br/>
Timber splintered to wet matches.<br/>
We go unvisited, get through.<br/>
A different yesterday<br/>
mines were running full blast.<br/>
I remember fires blown on the beach,<br/>
as seagulls few<br/>
an ore boat sank before rescue.<br/>
White pines broke from their roots.<br/>
Footings were lost.<br/>
Farther, the more silent after —<br/>
the sky tolls blue.<br/>

I am called to the insomniac<br/>
timetables of birth<br/>
at three a.m. or on the way<br/>
to somewhere else.<br/>
I drop everything, on my knees,<br/>
listen to the body’s<br/>
wall, watch the private door<br/>
that must nearly rupture.<br/>
Like a mother, must pace and wait<br/>
at the table’s edge<br/>
to unhinge the gate<br/>
and empty herself.<br/>
On the other side, waters<br/>
break in a ripple<br/>
through the parabola.<br/>
The naked self comes,<br/>
a perilous umbilical journey<br/>
on its pale vine<br/>
carrying on a correspondence<br/>
with death. I smell blood<br/>
and sweat in the tunnel<br/>
of physical labor.<br/>
Sometimes I knead the muscles<br/>
coax a new position<br/>
help open the bony locks.<br/>
Into the palms from the breach<br/>
life grasps the air. Cries.<br/>
I catch — wipe with a torn cloth<br/>
an animal power unleashed, released<br/>
that wakes and goes to sleep.<br/>
I cut the cord, take<br/>
the blue glossy web<br/>
of afterbirth to plant in the orchard<br/>
bind the wounds<br/>
bring blankets to wind the new<br/>
into another circle<br/>
guide the searching mouth<br/>
to the blind nipple.<br/>

In <i>Rebel Girl</i>, she wrote:<br/>
“All that summer the strike<br/>
dragged out a dogged existence.<br/>
We raced up and down the Range<br/>
from one end to another<br/>
in an old bakery truck, driven<br/>
by a couple of young Italian strikers,<br/>
who often forgot we were not bread<br/>
and bounced us unmercilessly<br/>
over the unpaved, rocky road.<br/>
The deputies came to know the truck<br/>
and took potshots at us,<br/>
so we had to stop using it,<br/>
much to our relief. There were<br/>
about fourteen towns from one end<br/>
to another which we covered.<br/>
Several times the strikers marched<br/>
the length of the Range, holding meetings<br/>
in each town. Sometimes<br/>
towns shut off the drinking water<br/>
while we were there.”<br/>

Hands clasped, he looks away<br/>
from the camera. Out the window,<br/>
an oriole sings. He might confess<br/>
there were things he misnamed —<br/>
</p><p>
he never mended a rift. Years passed<br/>
and work never ceased. At the table<br/>
waits a loaf of fresh-baked bread<br/>
drifted with seed, a sharp knife<br/>
</p><p>
and a bowl of soup, just stirred. He put<br/>
his spectacles on the book he had always<br/>
meant to read. He coughs to clear his throat.<br/>
The photographer pressed the shutter<br/>

fell into tender crumb, an accident of light.<br/>

A light in the chalice burns,<br/>
a marriage of fuel and fame<br/>
about to become ash.<br/>
Commended to God<br/>
all the digressions and processions.<br/>
Blessed the lovers who came and left<br/>
the husband whose child she brought<br/>
through her body, seeds she planted<br/>
in the rain.<br/>
She pushed back the cold<br/>
crumpled the old news, lit a match<br/>
in a house of receding voices<br/>
doors opening, phone calls<br/>
burials and excavations.<br/>
Time builds like a wave<br/>
and her prayers break into spray.<br/>
Her husband will be lost too young.<br/>
After he goes, a furnace comes.<br/>
In this house of bread and potatoes<br/>
she peels the skins and plunges her hands<br/>
into dishwater. People need to be fed.<br/>
She washes the cups,<br/>
boils clothes on the stove,<br/>
churns her own butter.<br/>
In the corners, orange dust covers tools<br/>
from another life, ways of the old country<br/>
lit by charges of dynamite.<br/>
She makes coffee that evaporates.<br/>
In this house, she contracts<br/>
with the night<br/>
wakes to sirens after mine accidents.<br/>
Strangers knock at the door<br/>
she supports their unions.<br/>
She breathes them in and out as vapor<br/>
bears every broadcast.<br/>
Weddings, baptisms,<br/>
midsummer dances.<br/>
She saves their photographs<br/>
covers the tomatoes threatened by frost.<br/>
At day, she sings loud so<br/>
those underground can hear.<br/>
Her voice carries across water<br/>
rides with the rivers that split at the Divide.<br/>
Each note she plays from the piano’s heart<br/>
is hammered into her own valves.<br/>

Lunch boxes gray as artillery.<br/>
No heels to wobble<br/>

fingernails stained by toil.<br/>
Ton after ton loaded on rails.<br/>

the ground that they were standing on.<br/>

Cold shop. Bleak light.<br/>
She turns to face the lay off.<br/>
The company, she’s never trusted.<br/>
The whistle blew. Inside, hard<br/>
to tell day from night.<br/>
Safety glasses, standard issue.<br/>
Her hair combed from bobby pins<br/>
into corkscrew curls.<br/>
Fluorescent buzz.<br/>
Denim overalls. Kerchief.<br/>
Her pants with a hole worn through.<br/>
She blows black soot from her nose.<br/>
She wears a wool plaid sweater.<br/>
Her jacket’s slung on the chair.<br/>
In the back, a front end loader signals.<br/>
Her hand rests on the table. Nobody<br/>
doubts the fact she’s able. It’s rough.<br/>
She does what she does.<br/>
She will drive home<br/>
at morning to girls who look after<br/>
themselves. They fight.<br/>
It’s hard to sleep. Her joints ache<br/>
her lunch pail has rusted.<br/>
In the back pocket of her pants<br/>
she keeps something to protect herself.<br/>

I was born in the north<br/>
beneath boughs of Norway pines that carried<br/>
the wind over an ocean<br/>
that rocked my grandmother aboard her ship.<br/>
She slipped me into the new country,<br/>
humming, an egg inside of an egg,<br/>
all in her basket and married a lumberjack<br/>
in the country of the Wobblies.<br/>
</p><p>
I come from the accordion.<br/>
I follow the steps at country dances,<br/>
come from the sand beaches on the Baltic,<br/>
from Kalajoki, from borders that moved,<br/>
from the pale white flowers that come like snow,<br/>
from Sibelius. One language blooms from another.<br/>
The old vowels and new leaves, easily trampled.<br/>
In school, my mother was held back.<br/>
My father dropped out at age thirteen to drive the school bus.<br/>
I was born into the summer fields swaying with timothy.<br/>
Into Minnesota. I came after my grandmother’s diphtheria<br/>
and my aunt’s tuberculosis.<br/>
</p><p>
I come from dovetailed corners,<br/>
from furrows of sandy loam planted with potatoes,<br/>
eyes in the dark and roots reaching deep into the soil.<br/>
McCarthy was chasing communists<br/>
and our poets were blacklisted.<br/>
My father couldn’t find steady work.<br/>
My mother took shifs in the shirt factory.<br/>
She gathered pinecones by the bushel<br/>
to sell to the Forest Service.<br/>
</p><p>
My grandmother remained at the border<br/>
unable to cross into the new language.<br/>
She pushed us over. The white fags<br/>
were the dish towels the girls tied<br/>
on their heads when they went into the dairy.<br/>
</p><p>
I stayed warm because they burned their frewood.<br/>
I lived on trades made with a side of beef.<br/>
I tripped levers of the dump rake<br/>
behind my father’s tractor. I wore hand-me-downs.<br/>
My parts were bought from junkyards.<br/>
I travelled inside the library.<br/>
</p><p>
My mother tied me to her apron,<br/>
spoke words that I never understood.<br/>
She salted me like fish, churned me into butter.<br/>
I follow her threads fraying, broken, woven<br/>
into the rag rug under my feet. She was dancing<br/>
in that dress. She was opening the bellows<br/>
of the accordion when I heard its breath.<br/>
</p><p>
I follow the threads back<br/>
through her scissor cuts, back through the eye<br/>
of her needle. She has wet me with her tongue.<br/>
I take her into the American vernacular,<br/>
drive her language to its destination,<br/>
play the volume on high<br/>
in a minor key, old music.<br/>

The pendulum of the clock<br/>
swung – the bodies in motion.<br/>
Think of grandmother’s face<br/>
when she was young.<br/>
The accordions echo time and resistance<br/>
inebriate Prohibition<br/>
go from straight to syncopation<br/>
uneven rhyme. Close your eyes.<br/>
The places her toes wore through<br/>
dancing shoes gave way<br/>
to the rise of smoke in neon haze<br/>
a flash of silver light on the mic.<br/>
Open the clasp on the case<br/>
spread the diamond, lif<br/>
the bellows, press the chords<br/>
open wide.<br/>
The hellos of death, nothing can erase<br/>
the bloom of birds in paradise.<br/>
No words can place the miles you ride<br/>
along the coast at sunset.<br/>
You played the halls, emptying your chest.<br/>
In the velvet dark, sorrow<br/>
holds its breath.<br/>
Once you slid into the leather harness<br/>
(no voice tomorrow)<br/>
hands on the ivories and ebonies<br/>
and made the stars race in a steeplechase<br/>
heedless.<br/>

through the kitchen.<br/>
Arranged their skirts,<br/>

They threaded needles<br/>
and pierced each other’s marriages.<br/>
They unspooled the delicate thread<br/>
and cut it with their teeth.<br/>
They took up the stack of children’s dungarees<br/>
to mend the knees.<br/>
They ripped out old seams.<br/>
They put on patches, darned the heels,<br/>
fastened buttons, repaired<br/>
fallen hems. In a month,<br/>
they would do this at another’s house.<br/>
They spoke with mouths full of pins,<br/>

old hurts fare.<br/>
There are those who do not speak.<br/>
Ice hardens and evaporates.<br/>
Strawberries ripen.<br/>
Her fingers pull each berry<br/>
from its green star.<br/>
She fills her pot to the brim.<br/>
Some fall from the vine<br/>
and plant their tiny seeds at her feet.<br/>
Some find their way<br/>
to other tongues.<br/>
The wood violets bloom.<br/>
In the night, she hears<br/>
the calls of the fox to the vixen<br/>
and the vixen’s answers —<br/>
yes, yes, yes.<br/>
Light arrives long after a star burns out.<br/>

then a howl rise and fall<br/>

a timber wolf inside a pack of wolves<br/>
a howl not of distance but nearness<br/>
not of loneliness but hunger<br/>
heard the swaying in the crowns of tall pines<br/>
a sh sh sh that holds the force of death aloft<br/>
so hardly a wisp of hair moves<br/>
heard not the day’s wind<br/>
but the wind of many years<br/>
arriving, departing<br/>
light falling between worlds<br/>

made a hurried leap from dark spruce<br/>

into silent snow she floats<br/>
through grass kneeling under the weight<br/>

Three months later — it was morning —<br/>

taking the sunlight into her coat.<br/>

burnishing agates with her heat<br/>
pouring copper into the puddle<br/>
gone before I could reach that place.<br/>

		nothing to lose but our chains —Joseph Kalar

One night, around a bonfire in a gravel pit<br/>
near Biwabik, beer glowed with firelight.<br/>
Music blasted through car speakers.<br/>
It was getting cold beyond the fire.<br/>
A river was falling over stones<br/>
through Merritt Lake through Esquagama<br/>
clouds pouring through the culverts<br/>
carrying the moon into Superior.<br/>
All my life I listened<br/>
to the trains taking this earth away<br/>
to the ships in the harbor to the steel mills.<br/>
There was a story I’d heard<br/>
about the rats in the underground mine.<br/>
Some of the workers<br/>
tied string to crusts of bread<br/>
to drop through the floorboards<br/>
in the lunchroom.<br/>
This was recreation. The rats took the bait<br/>
and miners reeled them back.<br/>
Now we have open pits, taconite and big plants<br/>
with rolling furnaces to make pellets<br/>
from the grey dust, a breakthrough<br/>
in technology. We emptied the keg<br/>
peered into the walls of night and fell deeper.<br/>
I brought up the word ‘oubliette’<br/>
a dungeon with the opening at the top<br/>
the word with the same root as oblivion.<br/>
No way out.<br/>
Some wanted to get on at the mine.<br/>
Some were going away if they could.<br/>
Some were going to die young.<br/>
Below the stars of the Big Dipper<br/>
sirens wailed<br/>
our voices rose, effervescence<br/>
sparks flying.<br/>

I heard in the blasting<br/>
in the pit<br/>
the low growl of the cat-skinners<br/>
and steam shovels<br/>
filling 240 ton dump trucks<br/>
carrying the rock to the Crusher<br/>
</p><p>
I heard in the machine shops<br/>
in the Concentrator<br/>
in the Fines<br/>
near the bentonite<br/>
behind the sliding doors<br/>
in the Agglomerator<br/>
in the constant roar<br/>
of the rolling furnaces<br/>
turning the taconite pellets<br/>
on the conveyors moving along<br/>
the small wheels<br/>
amid the vibration of high voltage<br/>
through vents and catwalks<br/>
the motors surging<br/>
</p><p>
I heard in the idling train<br/>
at the loading dock<br/>
as the dump cars filled<br/>
with the steaming loads<br/>
in black dust and whistles<br/>
from the electricians and millwrights<br/>
and the laborers<br/>
in the dry in the lunchroom<br/>
in the elevator the word<br/>
<i>strike</i>.<br/>
Whispers —<br/>
the weapon of the working man<br/>
who gives his life to taconite<br/>
a <i>strike</i> against the distant capitalists<br/>
or corporations who never show<br/>
their faces here<br/>
and yet draw out the marrow of our bones<br/>
quiet preparations<br/>
for a battle with an enemy<br/>
who fights back with layoffs and lockouts.<br/>
</p><p>
Wildcat — unauthorized by the union<br/>
— a mutiny.<br/>
The next day I turned<br/>
back at the picket line<br/>
would not cross the men<br/>
carrying signs. There were those<br/>
that hiked into the mine through the back ways<br/>
climbed fences, camped in the dries<br/>
to keep the plant running<br/>
and not cut off the supplies —<br/>
scabs they were called —<br/>
skin to be sloughed off.<br/>
</p><p>
I listened to the words spat after the end<br/>
read the graffiti scratched<br/>
into the freight elevator —<br/>
exploitation or fair exchange<br/>
as a woman listens to a man<br/>
an immigrant listens to the natural born citizen<br/>
finding between the lines<br/>
a noise, a dust, an open pit.<br/>

the dandelion seeds float<br/>

In 1916, in Biwabik during the strike<br/>
an accident happened<br/>
when the company’s guards<br/>
visited the house of Philip Masonovich.<br/>
Some said it was over a drink<br/>
but that’s not what others think.<br/>
A blind pig was implicated —<br/>
a family who took in a boarder.<br/>
A grudge unsettled them<br/>
a strike at fever pitch.<br/>
It began underground where<br/>
the intestinal rivers wound<br/>
through mineral maps.<br/>
It began in extraction of the geomagnetic<br/>
fields in the Canadian Shield<br/>
with the mining of ores taken for steel<br/>
paving the continent<br/>
with bridges and tracks. It began<br/>
in locations, in mines<br/>
where money drained from the pockets<br/>
and the hires carried dynamite caps.<br/>
It began with fires burning<br/>
behind clouds of smoke, the false night<br/>
among the silhouettes,<br/>
filters turning yellow and wet.<br/>
Some coughed in unison and spoke<br/>
in foreign tongues, in code.<br/>
Some were liars.<br/>
Thick ores and clay and blood<br/>
mix in crush wounds and miner’s lung.<br/>
It began in thin pay envelopes.<br/>
A bullet found its way out of the gun<br/>
but the aim was wrong.<br/>
One man was gone.<br/>
There were some who broke the rules<br/>
and there were stools.<br/>
Women couldn’t remove the stains —<br/>
they buried the remains<br/>
but the work went on.<br/>
A woman and infant were detained in the local jail.<br/>
Wobblies on another road miles away<br/>
were arrested for inciting to riot<br/>
put on trial.<br/>
Some votes were lost — some were won.<br/>
A hundred years went by.<br/>

If moon, then only crescents<br/>
continuous rough music<br/>
of verb and noun<br/>
to shine that road upon the lake<br/>
trouble the tongue —<br/>
keep sonorous secrets.<br/>
In the distillery<br/>
underground,<br/>
work to make ruinous<br/>
beauty. In imaging<br/>
pare it down, find the essence.<br/>
Work double duty<br/>
to intoxicate, delete and deliberate<br/>
expand the seams<br/>
increase the proof<br/>
stay aloof.<br/>
In the condensery<br/>
turn up the heat<br/>
on the copper tubing<br/>
harness the steam.<br/>
Pour out both heads and tails<br/>
drink wild gleams.<br/>
Burial Mounds and Old Mines<br/>
In the shimmer of violet rain<br/>
along old paths<br/>
of a thousand years, along Esquagama —<br/>
crows look right and left<br/>
into roots that run into old blood<br/>
deep in the earth’s repository.<br/>
Ancestor bundles were taken up<br/>
by the tribes<br/>
and moved to this site with other bones —<br/>
we don’t know why.<br/>
Glaciers have gone into the sky.<br/>
Women had consequence.<br/>
A thousand years of rain<br/>
make a high banter with the crowns<br/>
of trees while the earth swallows flint<br/>
clay vessels and copper implements.<br/>
A thousand years of excavating<br/>
and we are paid in pebbles.<br/>
Rain comes down like a sigh.<br/>
Arrows are pulled from the targets.<br/>
Our wars, our burdens are many,<br/>
we wait for discovery<br/>
in the sound of rain falling on folded leaves<br/>
in the silence<br/>
before the forest and after the forest is gone.<br/>
A fish jumps at the wings of insects.<br/>
Birds swoop.<br/>

i.<br/>
Come into the car<br/>
look into the dark with me.<br/>
In the knitting<br/>
I was cast on or was my yarn<br/>
on my grandmother’s sticks<br/>
in vein-lined hands<br/>
stitch after stitch<br/>
and a few of those dropped.<br/>
Now a hole runs deep.<br/>
I carry the loop<br/>
of invisible ores<br/>
whispering at night<br/>
flights of bats<br/>
wind in the tunnels and farther<br/>
in the seep of water.<br/>
</p><p>
ii.<br/>
The click-click never ends.<br/>
Do you notice while knitting<br/>
that progress is unraveling?<br/>
Tipsy, motion sick, sleepy<br/>
I extend the garment<br/>
invite you to try on the vowels<br/>
give you this edge<br/>
lift the smell of hot pine needles<br/>
and their roots<br/>
as the bank of the river dissolves<br/>
takes mud to the sea<br/>
murmurs through the night<br/>
to bring the long horizon<br/>
the sunlight.<br/>
I remember the sound<br/>
of waves against the boat<br/>
arriving, departing, passing beneath<br/>
the glance of custom officers<br/>
who stamped a seal on my passport.<br/>
Over the border and back<br/>
exhaling —<br/>
a note sung out, hummed<br/>
flung out like seed in its case<br/>
buried and broken and stitched<br/>
by the earth who feeds us with rain.<br/>
Inside the minerals rise.<br/>
The plant grows a root, a tendril<br/>
some sort of mercy.<br/>
</p><p>
iii.<br/>
The hawks kettle<br/>
above the crowns of timber<br/>
taken down.<br/>
I mourn for their height<br/>
sing, hold the winged<br/>
moment of shade<br/>
to send ahead<br/>
say all the syllables are<br/>
ours — all the lost<br/>
lonely in the dark<br/>
rustlings<br/>
breakings, the violence<br/>
never meant or done on purpose<br/>
short-sighted, mean<br/>
steam shoveled<br/>
done with an instrument,<br/>
all that we buried in silence.<br/>
I sing of the new lands<br/>
the rooms they built<br/>
dreams that opened.<br/>
Of those I am speaking.<br/>
To my grand-daughters<br/>
and sons, the grandest<br/>
beginning, I bless<br/>
even the unresolved claims<br/>
the stripped and foreclosed —<br/>
all things do change.<br/>
</p><p>

My grandmother took in the sunset.<br/>
I speak in her crimson —<br/>
tip the glass.<br/>
She always gave with a warm hand<br/>
boiled the sap of the trees<br/>
for pancakes at the table<br/>
at sunrise collected<br/>
from the chickens’ squawks<br/>
a basket of eggs<br/>
warm from brooding.<br/>
Inside the nests are broken shells<br/>
little twigs, feathers given.<br/>
She washed the warm eggs<br/>
and broke them into the frying pan.<br/>
Marigold yolks, some doubled<br/>
served with salt and pepper<br/>
and a slab of bread<br/>
toasted in the skillet<br/>
sticky with honey.<br/>
</p><p>
v.<br/>
I tip the glass.<br/>
From the center<br/>
from flood and wind<br/>
I pour from my grandfather’s bottle —<br/>
from the accordion<br/>
his only luggage —<br/>
from the center of fire or star<br/>
essential spark of ancestors<br/>
that gleams in the eye,<br/>
I pour.<br/>
</p><p>
vi.<br/>
It is late but not for you.<br/>
Let’s drink to never again.<br/>
Refill the cups.<br/>
No went on and became yes<br/>
what came after is anyone’s guess.<br/>
Here’s to hope<br/>
you will bring your warm hand too.<br/>
I depend upon it<br/>
pour my love and the mothers’<br/>
before, give every stitch<br/>
of warmth to the cold.<br/>
Take heart, the chained heart<br/>
the foreign, added-on heart,<br/>
the singing of a bird.<br/>
Listen to the knitting of the invisible<br/>
ores whispering at night,<br/>
winged flights, listen<br/>
to the wind in the trees<br/>
and farther, listen —<br/>
love’s pouring clear like water.<br/>

I woke as if on a dark<br/>
platform, everything departed.<br/>
Raining in the windows<br/>
into my sleep<br/>
stars or moon or mist,<br/>
revolving.<br/>
I’ve travelled far,<br/>
the train erases its tracks.<br/>
It is not as if I did not know this —<br/>
away<br/>
is a drifting continent<br/>
stone of an iron mountain.<br/>
I turn toward it<br/>
as if my body were all voices<br/>
silenced and listening to the dark.<br/>
In the beginning<br/>
separation<br/>
day from night and water from sky<br/>
now me<br/>
the way of all things.<br/>
The hands are feathers<br/>
now<br/>
they can not grasp or hold<br/>

her blades on black ice<br/>

silver and precise.<br/>
She warms up<br/>
the dance<br/>

intoxication and chance.<br/>
She’s carving the surface<br/>
with hardly a glance<br/>
racing from shore<br/>
to lift when she leaps —<br/>

releasing the pain in her feet<br/>
almost blue.<br/>

Drowning near<br/>

All winter, as I kindled the fire<br/>
my body burned days on end<br/>
not sexual but acrid<br/>
at the stake<br/>
the little girl kept by her father<br/>
at the table<br/>
to finish her dinner,<br/>
my adolescent selves,<br/>
the wives I was, a conflagration,<br/>
my own immolation of the past.<br/>
At the end, I turned into charcoal,<br/>
a bear, and burned even brighter<br/>
as I carried my ash to the icy road.<br/>
All winter back and forth<br/>
I spoke with the tongues of flames.<br/>
At night I tied myself<br/>
to the sound of breathing,<br/>
the waves of in- and exhalation,<br/>
pulled up my boat on an empty shore.<br/>
In mornings when the world<br/>
came back, I floated<br/>
upon the surface of light,<br/>
resurrected and lost my self<br/>
to the waters, in vapor<br/>
and ice and free.<br/>
Then noise surged — trees felled<br/>
tunnels bored through the iron mountain<br/>
my body, bull-dozed.<br/>
Ache — just another word for gravity<br/>
stone crags, granite faces<br/>
ledges lifted by glaciers<br/>
that came and left, carried by trains<br/>
iron strip-mined.<br/>
I was weathered and worn<br/>
by the rivers that sprung<br/>
from underground<br/>
with eruptions and slides<br/>
floods, quakes, lightning strikes<br/>
made into shadow, eclipsed.<br/>
I have been travelling<br/>
in four directions<br/>
borne into the hands<br/>
of those doing menial work.<br/>
I take this life<br/>
to give to the wind, my breath —<br/>
with the strings of an instrument<br/>
give to the flames, give to the water<br/>
give to the earth.<br/>

nothing you can see<br/>

no berries yet, nor needs.<br/>
The water climbs<br/>

take in minerals<br/>
beneath the balsam<br/>
over the border<br/>
past the landing<br/>
in the stone face of granite<br/>
above the water’s mirror<br/>
in a boat I ride by small islands<br/>
where root dives into stone<br/>
amid broken limbs of white pine<br/>
behind the reflection of day<br/>
into dark endings<br/>
reach for my own reaching<br/>
hand in the cold water<br/>
of October — for a tail flick of a fin<br/>
among the sunken shoulders<br/>
in a vein of ore.<br/>
To take from another body<br/>
is a question<br/>
answered by loon<br/>

searching the char of a cold fire.<br/>

travel along the highway<br/>
shift and jostle one another<br/>
inspecting bits of gravel —<br/>

cannot bring themselves to any unity<br/>

I return but it’s all excavation — me<br/>
an employee of the organization.<br/>
I remember a long road past a gate,<br/>
a dead landscape.<br/>
Dust. Noise. First the Crusher and then<br/>
where I worked, the Agglomerator<br/>
with conveyors to the trains.<br/>
First stop, the dry.<br/>
A sink like a Roman fountain.<br/>
Clothes blackened by taconite, yellow and white<br/>
hard hats, coveralls, steel toed boots,<br/>
safety glasses, the whistle<br/>
starting and stopping each shift.<br/>
For this, I propped myself on a ledge<br/>
for the paycheck.<br/>
Steel beams, high voltage. Dripping grease.<br/>
One of the crew leaning on a high pressure<br/>
water hose, blowing dust out of my nose<br/>
into a handkerchief, pushing spillage<br/>
down the sloping concrete floors<br/>
below rolling furnaces,<br/>
swallowing salt tablets from dispensers.<br/>
On a swing shift, counting<br/>
days till the long weekend<br/>
taking smoke breaks, and calculating<br/>
what falling asleep on graveyards might cost.<br/>
All night and day, the trains came to load<br/>
at the ore docks.<br/>
In the lunchroom, I took from my lunch pail<br/>
a paperback. Kept myself awake<br/>
with coffee from my thermos<br/>
avoided pellets and their third degree burns<br/>
stared into the middle distance<br/>
not the ends but the means —<br/>
working below the surface.<br/>

distant theories.<br/>

they both looked away.<br/>
The star in the shoulder<br/>
of Orion<br/>
in gravitational collapse<br/>
a violent stellar wind too far<br/>

He looked toward the barn<br/>

the Red Star brand<br/>

one to drive the nails<br/>

into the bright sun of the last century.<br/>
They clop to the barn door<br/>
squinting like immigrants, a smell<br/>
of hay and manure and dust<br/>
from their chestnut flanks.<br/>
The shod hooves strike the blue slate<br/>

Leather harness, reins, the silver rings jingle.<br/>
The Belgians whinny for a bag of oats.<br/>
Their weight shifts.<br/>
My grandmother turns from the sight<br/>
from the window that catches the sunset<br/>
with its fire, in the same house that burns down<br/>
on the foundation that will remain<br/>
and one lone timber holding up the sky<br/>
the same timber the bird chooses for her nest.<br/>
My grandmother pulled back<br/>
her skirts, kept the children inside.<br/>
She’s taken her breath away<br/>
from his shoulder and throat,<br/>
the endless schemes to trade this and that<br/>
and now the horses for a gold watch.<br/>
She holds her tongue<br/>
the air as cold as the potato cellar<br/>
as cold as the bottom of the swamp<br/>
as the peat beneath the trees<br/>
as the St. Louis River that winds<br/>
through the homestead and its snow drifts.<br/>
Her quilt wears down to fragile threads.<br/>

My father plows two fields.<br/>
My grandmother hears the Belgians neigh<br/>
sees the shadow of an old man<br/>
dragged by their shadows. Nights come.<br/>

I remember the long traces —<br/>
the hame on the collar<br/>
that hung on the barn wall<br/>
the weathered boards of the cart,<br/>
my sister on the back<br/>
of two kinds of knowledge.<br/>
My mother sings the songs her mother sang<br/>

The bird weaves the nest with twigs<br/>

shells crack open<br/>

my father stopped our car<br/>
and my mother paused in her talking.<br/>
On the shoulder of the empty stretch<br/>
was a lone woman walking.<br/>
The neighbor —<br/>
neither parent registered surprise.<br/>
No houses nearby, no way to a telephone.<br/>
She wiped her eyes.<br/>
The edges of her light coat were flapping.<br/>
She climbed in the back seat<br/>
next to me, bringing in cold drafts.<br/>
Her husband told her to get out<br/>
she said. He drove on without her.<br/>
Not the first time. I watched the ditch.<br/>
Nothing more was said. I could see<br/>
in the rearview mirror, an afterthought<br/>
in my father’s glance.<br/>
We travelled along in silence,<br/>
except for the radio singing.<br/>
I listened to the tires’ rhythm<br/>
on the cracks of the tarmac.<br/>
At her driveway, I heard my father’s question:<br/>
Is this where she wanted to be dropped off?<br/>
She pulled the door latch, thanked him.<br/>
Later, her husband mentioned the incident<br/>
if she wasn’t so stubborn — he apologized<br/>

with tentative steps —<br/>
as if to say to fox or wolf or husband with a gun:<br/>
I’ve come this far — has it all been a waste?<br/>
In his sights the bird<br/>
bolts into flight.<br/>

She burns with a fury<br/>
her blood turned to shower<br/>
<span class="indent2">of star —</span><br/>
in the atmosphere, cast out in high wind<br/>
burning in the late hour<br/>
night fire — red leaf.<br/>
When she returns in the hollow of throat<br/>
on each anniversary,<br/>
bring ash to the ceremony.<br/>
Grief burns in the lung<br/>
<span class="indent2">in the songs they sung.</span><br/>
In memory, I light her with my tongue.<br/>

The bear walks over ores<br/>
through the ring<br/>
of ice and Northern Lights.<br/>
A wind from two worlds blows.<br/>
I can smell the fire in her sauna stove.<br/>
She hands me the switch<br/>
birch striplings tied in a bundle.<br/>
They’ve just come to leaf.<br/>
She gives me a bear’s tooth.<br/>
She works at a loom<br/>
weaving the steel wire<br/>
unwound from a mineral skein.<br/>
The meridian moves when she moves.<br/>
Swaying in the heat,<br/>
I drink cold from the Big Dipper.<br/>
She steadies the handle.<br/>
One hand, calloused, grips like iron<br/>
and the other stirs the atmosphere.<br/>
She’s made from oils and canvas,<br/>
split screens and names that extend<br/>
from the landscape.<br/>
Inside she is deep crimson and violet.<br/>
A rose blooms from a vein of blood<br/>
that travels through dark mud underground<br/>
and comes up in the sun.<br/>
Water boils into steam and the stones speak.<br/>
Her incantations come.<br/>

Outside the plant, sisters grin,<br/>
their hair rolled and pinned.<br/>
They wear work clothes<br/>
and the lids of their welding shields<br/>
are lifted. It’s day shift.<br/>
Production is up.<br/>
The safety goggles gleam<br/>
slightly steamed in the sun —<br/>
as if they were just called away<br/>
from the acetylene torch<br/>
and the hot flame of rage<br/>
that makes unbreakable seams.<br/>
In the plants and shipyards<br/>
women just like these<br/>
man the supply lines fully capable<br/>
with the air of Amelia Earharts.<br/>
Their feet on the ground in Canton, Ohio<br/>
at the Spun Steel Corporation<br/>
are solid. Nobody could shove them aside.<br/>
Their bodies even dreams are weighted<br/>
by heavy aprons and gloves and high boots.<br/>
When they go home, they’ll sit on the porch<br/>
drink a beer, wait for the men<br/>
to arrive — to dote on babies — keep score<br/>
of baseball games broadcast on the radio.<br/>
After work, they wash the grime<br/>
off their necks and clean their nails<br/>
and though it isn’t polite<br/>
hawk the dust from their throats.<br/>

</header><p>
Dead people’s clothes<br/>
Aunt Grace brought from the nursing home.<br/>
The box flaps lifted as if she carried live souls.<br/>
Perfectly good, she said, but with<br/>
the whiff of medicine and toilets.<br/>
For the children, Grace gestured,<br/>
for dress up. But pretend wasn’t like that.<br/>
It was chaps and holsters and cowboy hats.<br/>
Aunt Martha took apart the men’s suits<br/>
with her seam ripper, to music.<br/>
She had been at the sanitarium for TB<br/>
pictured in a room full of iron beds<br/>
and sessions in the cold fresh air<br/>
wrapped in wool blankets<br/>
with those were her dearest friends —<br/>
a woman named Ricky<br/>
who never married and some<br/>
who didn’t make it. Ricky sent<br/>
another photo later, after they had been<br/>
released, posed with a hunting rifle.<br/>
She never had a child.<br/>
It’s just her way, Martha said. I tucked it<br/>
inside my head. There were women who<br/>
were like men, and there were women like<br/>
Martha who hummed and cut<br/>
with her shears, added darts, pressed with steam<br/>
basted the seams. Sewed the men’s wear<br/>
on her Singer sewing machine —<br/>
she used a tie and a shirt<br/>
the same pockets<br/>
and buttons and zippers and cuffs<br/>
but gave it a skirt.<br/>

I haul in with the freighters<br/>
glide beneath the aerial bridge<br/>
fall into the red grains of sand<br/>
walk with the migrating cranes<br/>
follow the hawks<br/>
rise from the wind<br/>
drive the waves into shore<br/>
break the breakers along the ledge<br/>
explode the light<br/>
push back the smoke of chimneys<br/>
press against the trains as they come<br/>
to the ore docks and back to the mines<br/>
and return to the inland sea<br/>
follow the creek from its mouth<br/>
through the culvert, up the slope<br/>
beneath the motors storming<br/>
on the freeway, scatter the trash<br/>
dishevel the Rose Garden<br/>
below the lifting flocks of birds<br/>
over young mothers with strollers<br/>
stir the dogs by the bookstore<br/>
drill with the dentist<br/>
cook with the chefs of Burrito Union<br/>

climb the iron foot-bridge<br/>

tip the old cedar<br/>
follow the homeless<br/>
and student and middle-aged<br/>
streets that merge into the city<br/>
glimmer in the crowns<br/>
of old white pines<br/>
find my way under bridges<br/>
to the pileated woodpecker<br/>
shine in the city lights<br/>
over the roofs, to the monastery<br/>
and university into the sky<br/>
and down again<br/>
sway with erotic dancers<br/>
and sleep with the dead in the mortuary<br/>
come through tar and feathers<br/>
and terrible fatalities<br/>
wars and old age<br/>
read my names on the stones<br/>
speak to the owls<br/>
wander through alleys past kitchen windows<br/>
where women break eggs into pans<br/>
bring the children home<br/>
make the dogs bark<br/>
exhale with babies breath and ferns<br/>
in the cases of the florists<br/>
shine through diamonds and gold<br/>
of the jewelers<br/>
through the brokenness at the shelters<br/>
in the paper plants<br/>
in the picketers at the clinic<br/>
in the liquor stores<br/>
fall through the heat of summer<br/>

gleam like the candles in restaurants<br/>
in neon messages, in casino slots<br/>

rise in the scent of sesame oil<br/>

fresh ground coffee<br/>
Italian sausage through fennel seed<br/>
and crust of bread and slice of cheese<br/>
clatter in silverware<br/>
rise through the smokers of fish<br/>
and in the barbecue<br/>
through the brewery<br/>
spill as foam over the brim<br/>
echo through the voices<br/>
the heels on the bricks<br/>
ferment and pour into<br/>
the smudged goblets<br/>
come to those in debt<br/>
in Emergency and Intensive Care<br/>
map the body’s breath<br/>
sweep along the floor<br/>
of barbers and barkeeps and bachelors<br/>
waiters and Grandmothers for Peace<br/>
in chambers and markets and charts<br/>
of meteorologists<br/>
slumber in the jails<br/>
and bookstores<br/>
gamble with the lovers<br/>
newly met, and invest with<br/>
the patient, the irritated, separated<br/>
come to the first kiss<br/>
to silent exchanges and glances<br/>
to the crowning head in delivery, the cry<br/>
of the newborn’s father<br/>
burn in the tobacco<br/>
and fold in the newspapers<br/>
come through the vibration<br/>
of strings, through the clarinets<br/>
and brass, through the hands of musicians<br/>
through dark night<br/>
through long and sleepless trembling<br/>
through pain of needles and rehabilitations<br/>
over the bridge and under the bridge<br/>
through strokes of artists on blank canvas<br/>
through dark matter and despair<br/>
cold damp of the deepest mine<br/>
and hellish furnaces<br/>
through fevers and dreams<br/>
come through a seed<br/>
rise into stem and leaf<br/>
fall back to earth<br/>
come through the mist<br/>
rain down the lake<br/>
rise from the wind<br/>
drive waves into shore<br/>
break the breakers along the ledge<br/>
explode the light.<br/>

A stranger checked into a room<br/>
in the Tremont Hotel<br/>
at the end of the line<br/>
tipped the porter a token to lift<br/>
her portmanteau.<br/>
She arrived — no lady —<br/>
in a ruin of red brick<br/>
with a view. Bats came in<br/>
rodents hurried through chinks<br/>
in the walls, vandals<br/>
broke the window glass.<br/>
The mercury lights arrived<br/>
and fell through. Walls<br/>
starved down to ribs<br/>
and floors dropped beneath<br/>
the ceiling’s downslide.<br/>
Pipes went silent. Spiders watch.<br/>
She won’t lie. There’s been<br/>
a lot of traffic coming by.<br/>
Trades are not sweet.<br/>
Either people are blind<br/>
or she is invisible, light<br/>
as powder on the empty<br/>
bureau where she writes<br/>
with the tip of her finger.<br/>
Some pray, some get high<br/>
chase a train that has long<br/>
ago left the station.<br/>
With deep concentration<br/>
she climbs between sheets of rain.<br/>
The hinges of door creak<br/>
and the wind whispers<br/>
to the new moon<br/>
who will soon knock.<br/>

I’ll meet you here<br/>
on traces of the deep red ore<br/>
beneath our feet<br/>
where old growth and mineral rights<br/>
have been taken away.<br/>
I’ll meet you under the sky<br/>
on the Iron Range<br/>
where immigrants arrived<br/>
speaking other languages.<br/>
Workers lifted the corner stones into place<br/>
from Finland, Albuquerque, the desert,<br/>
from east and west<br/>
where bears walk and ores whisper.<br/>
I’ll meet you here among the pines<br/>
and thousand lakes<br/>
where I swam and drifted as a child<br/>
down the St. Louis River<br/>
that flowed beneath the bridges<br/>
on the Vermilion Trail.<br/>
In the magnetic North —<br/>
at the edge of the wild where mist rises<br/>
and eagles fly<br/>
over the Laurentian Divide<br/>
where our ancestors<br/>
received the rivers’ gifts —<br/>
to change — turn in a new direction — to flow<br/>
away from oceans we once called home.<br/>

A ship hangs on a thread<br/>
above the pews of a church<br/>
in Kalajoki<br/>
where my great-grandmother wed<br/>
where I’ve made passage<br/>
with a satchel<br/>
and handful of photographs.<br/>
The ship floats on the high notes<br/>
of hymns above the heads<br/>
and turns on the rising heat<br/>
where the pastor breaks bread.<br/>
The vessel left port<br/>
when she was young<br/>
went through the Baltic<br/>
into the Atlantic<br/>
but never arrived<br/>
in Newfoundland.<br/>
The names on the head-stones<br/>
in the churchyard<br/>
pass through my bones.<br/>
Oblivious of the foundered<br/>
not burdened by dread,<br/>
a child laughed<br/>
and ran from his mother.<br/>
She warned him<br/>
in the mother language<br/>
beneath the keel<br/>
shifting in the notes<br/>
played by the organ.<br/>
If in my grandfather’s lap<br/>
my mother sailed, and if I in hers —<br/>
what might be found<br/>
or run aground<br/>
on currents of song<br/>
of breath.<br/>

Birch bark<br/>
on my path this morning<br/>
after the summer rain along the sea.<br/>
A powdery, damp, torn flag<br/>
or scroll from the map<br/>
of unknown territories<br/>
without north, without a key.<br/>
From the mushroomed<br/>
floor, no mark of seed, root, or leaf.<br/>
Whatever was written, erased.<br/>
Torsos fallen, empty sleeves.<br/>
Outside, bleached as bone<br/>
inside, a rosy skin.<br/>
I took that scrap and nailed<br/>
to the wall<br/>
a silence I want to keep.<br/>

On a threshold<br/>
after felling of trees<br/>

wind pulled the smoke<br/>
from the stacks<br/>
and men took off their caps<br/>
rubbed their forearms<br/>
over their faces and left<br/>
as sun and rain soothed<br/>
the pitch and stumps<br/>
and woke the buried cones<br/>
while diesel trucks delivered<br/>
the freight of reams<br/>
torn open in this room —<br/>
each empty sheet<br/>
a ground of seeds waking<br/>

After the whistle blew<br/>
we danced invisible circles<br/>
turning the wheel with our palms<br/>
around the clock<br/>
rolling on wheels beneath our feet.<br/>
We blew smoke to the clouds<br/>
met the dawn<br/>
drank beer from a case<br/>
until the sky turned silver<br/>
and sun reached the highest notes.<br/>
On the backroad<br/>
behind the mines we drove<br/>
around the horn.<br/>
Wind blew upon the mouthpiece<br/>
in morning glory<br/>
while we tossed the empties<br/>
into the ditch<br/>
and the day crew thrust<br/>
their shovels into the pit.<br/>
When we pressed on the gas<br/>
the valves of the car<br/>
matched the far sound of the plant.<br/>
Train cars loaded<br/>
to go to the harbor —<br/>
cross arms lowered to hold us back.<br/>
The train cars dumped at the ore docks.<br/>
Pellets rolled in the hold<br/>
below and the ship signalled<br/>
to the bridge and the bridge answered,<br/>
a fanfare for the working man.<br/>
Shadows danced<br/>
and the plants blew smoke to the clouds<br/>
until there was no ground.<br/>
Only a hole with the sound.<br/>
