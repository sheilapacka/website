I came home<br/>
to hear the great grey owl<br/>
call into<br/>
the early dark of winter<br/>
beyond the clearing<br/>
over the growl and screech<br/>
of an animal sheltered<br/>
by a fallen tree<br/>
burrowed out of reach<br/>
of the talons and beak<br/>
below the black tangle<br/>
and pine spears<br/>
above the crystalline snow<br/>
between day turning into night<br/>
and the moon’s light<br/>
emanating from cold drifts —<br/>
a merciless hide and seek<br/>
followed by inscrutable silence<br/>
awoken by the voice of a dream<br/>
I saw the dark angel lift<br/>
its wings into the old ash<br/>
near and far the gleam of star<br/>
or flame with no in- or exhalation<br/>
where wind hauls its ice<br/>
and diamonds sift<br/>
into the blue night<br/>

In the forest we cross paths.<br/>
Trees shift like a curtain<br/>
and the magician in black coat tails<br/>
steps into the spotlight.<br/>
</p><p>
Fears loom like large boxes on wheels.<br/>
I watch darkness in the darkness<br/>
take in one breath at the edge<br/>
while the other side rolls like a dark sea.<br/>
</p><p>
Is this the god that summoned me?<br/>
</p><p>
The bear has no sleight of hand<br/>
it conceals, reveals<br/>
silhouette, dark coat, red sequins, flashing swords.<br/>
</p><p>
I heard wings.<br/>
We come together for this ceremony<br/>
a dove flies up<br/>
time stutters, runs both forward and back.<br/>
</p><p>
A blade plunges in dark silk<br/>
in the hush, an electric solitude<br/>
I begin another journey.<br/>

The black of the bear<br/>
is the black of a pupil<br/>
which emits no light but takes it in<br/>
to the retina.<br/>
The encounter of a bear is ocular.<br/>
I have never felt, smelled<br/>
or touched a bear<br/>
only seen some<br/>
only heard one bawling.<br/>
The others were silent, in motion.<br/>
</p><p>
I can’t understand time.<br/>
If I moved, the past I left<br/>
transmitted into photographs<br/>
black and white.<br/>
As a child, I turned<br/>
the black pages of the photo album<br/>
to the picture fixed in black corners<br/>
of my father’s uncle Theodore<br/>
and his dog. The dog was nursing<br/>
beaver kits.<br/>
I keep this moment of love<br/>
before his suicide.<br/>
Everything changes.<br/>
</p><p>
Fear affects the pupils of the eye<br/>
emits no light but takes it in<br/>
works like a shutter<br/>
freezes the image.<br/>
</p><p>
My father worked midnights<br/>
drove a black Oldsmobile<br/>
kicked black tires.<br/>
He was smudged with soot<br/>
his fingernails stained<br/>
with grease, fed me<br/>
in the red kitchen chair<br/>
fearful stories of bears<br/>
only to keep me safe.<br/>
</p><p>
Now bears show themselves to me<br/>
cross the roads I’m on<br/>
enter the field<br/>
eat the berries I would eat<br/>
turn their heads so that I can see<br/>
their ears in silhouette.<br/>
</p><p>
I wear black, roam the countryside<br/>
love rising in my breast<br/>
to face all of them,<br/>
the beautiful, fearful bears.<br/>
Fifty years and more<br/>
I have lived in the north, in the woods<br/>
and dreaded what needed love<br/>
the emulsion<br/>
and source of light<br/>
the enduring motion.<br/>

raspberry canes scratch<br/>
as they drop their red fruit<br/>
</p><p>
at my feet.<br/>
Life used to be complete.<br/>
Yes it was unbearable<br/>
heat and a misery of flies.<br/>
</p><p>
Dishes have broken.<br/>
I gave away so much<br/>
the marriages and summers<br/>
some things I didn’t know<br/>
that held my spirit<br/>
</p><p>
like you once did.<br/>
It was dry ground<br/>
but also ripening.<br/>
I gather every ripe berry<br/>
stain and tongue.<br/>

Across the summers<br/>
through corridors of fluttering aspen<br/>
and birdsong, I rode a bicycle<br/>
along empty roads under a clear sky<br/>
crossed by turtles’ relentless journeys<br/>
towards the ponds and dragonflies<br/>
games of tag, dogs chasing<br/>
passing cars, entering the funnel cloud<br/>
of dust floating above the river<br/>
through the pines where birds flit<br/>
on the branches building nests<br/>
feeding the young, hurrying on to flights<br/>
longer and farther across the borders.<br/>
The roads had no end, only yearning.<br/>
This was the north, the clouds were a language<br/>
that cast its shadows on hills, still unpeopled<br/>
mornings carried the sounds of trains<br/>
history was still coming.<br/>

When I was small, I had no word for it.<br/>
It sifted in the Minnesota woods, in wind<br/>
whispering above me in the pine boughs<br/>
and waited inside the dark seeds ready<br/>
</p><p>
to split their hulls and stand up<br/>
like spring, green in the sun.<br/>
It sprouted like potatoes<br/>
in the cold cellar and in the ground<br/>
</p><p>
grazed with all the mares.<br/>
It was stacked in the sunlit dust<br/>
of the hay barn<br/>
and rusted with the car bodies<br/>
</p><p>
abandoned in the field<br/>
played on the burial mounds<br/>
walked over stories kept from me<br/>
and slept on the shores of all the lakes.<br/>
</p><p>
It rubbed between my immigrant grandmother<br/>
who couldn’t speak English<br/>
and me who couldn’t speak Finnish.<br/>
It ticked itself from the clock<br/>
</p><p>
rose like yeast that lifted the dough<br/>
in heat to bread. It wound in the yarn<br/>
she slipped with a hook, washed<br/>
through all the linens<br/>
</p><p>
swelled like the sister<br/>
beneath my mother’s apron<br/>
entered through the pores<br/>
of my skin and pushed out as breasts<br/>
</p><p>
pumped through my veins<br/>
and bled between my legs<br/>
slid beneath my skirt and buttoned<br/>
in my blouse. It steeped in my cup<br/>
</p><p>
floated in the church singing its hymns<br/>
repeated its vows in sentences<br/>
that trailed off<br/>
before too much could be said.<br/>
</p><p>
It was the echo of silence<br/>
before the storm and after<br/>
I heard it nights from inside the walls<br/>
later, in the backseats of cars<br/>
</p><p>
and from cattail beds<br/>
in hawks’ wings over the Divide —<br/>
where rivers split<br/>
into fast tongues.<br/>

the river ran over stones<br/>
in its bed, around bends.<br/>
He was still sleeping.<br/>

It was morning, she<br/>
was gathering things into<br/>
her suitcase. River was murmuring<br/>

because the time was near,<br/>
she was taking things off her list.<br/>
The leaves in the trees<br/>
were restless. Rain was coming.<br/>

She could only take so much<br/>
what she could carry<br/>
and wouldn’t be missed<br/>
A little bit of cash.<br/>
</p><p>
She used to play under the bridge<br/>
where the water wandered<br/>
as if it weren’t going anywhere<br/>
where sun distilled the leaves into tea<br/>
</p><p>
where she had picnics<br/>
in the shade. The river combed<br/>
the grass, braided her hair<br/>
into its current, shook her free.<br/>

She touched bottom<br/>
put her weight down, closed<br/>
the latch. Not a match<br/>
the violence.<br/>

In its silence the river took<br/>
those days out to sea<br/>
who knew where<br/>
she would cross or when —<br/>

the woman next door<br/>
knocked and gave her a book<br/>
pages torn, repaired with tape<br/>

couldn’t say goodbye<br/>

I wait for my sister —<br/>
pussy willows then single blades<br/>
of green appeared<br/>
amid the straw. Next catkins lengthened<br/>
on the branches<br/>
we walked below. Sometimes between<br/>
a bellwort blooms<br/>
as we wander through balsam trees.<br/>
She is trying to get away.<br/>
</p><p>
One day the hawk’s gaze<br/>
from an overhead wire<br/>
fell on me. The next day I found a wing<br/>
on the road, broken hinge<br/>
bloody bare — after that a rabbit crossed<br/>
my path pursued by a wolf into the thicket<br/>
neither glanced back.<br/>
God speed. Nothing more.<br/>
</p><p>
A few days later, I pass another<br/>
beheaded rabbit<br/>
abandoned to the crows.<br/>
We don’t imagine the worst, even her.<br/>
She doesn’t let herself see.<br/>
The buds open out into leaves<br/>
asparagus rises. I eat the chives’<br/>
hollow spears at the table —<br/>
</p><p>
a deer followed. My dog finds its sleek hoof.<br/>
We go on, amid the evidence<br/>
find marsh marigolds at spring streams<br/>
new planted trees.<br/>
The lilacs bud, we count the blooms.<br/>

My mother lit the burner<br/>
beneath the glass coffee pot<br/>
on the stove. I could hear the blue flame<br/>
water began to bubble<br/>
push itself up the slender glass stem<br/>
into the glass lid, rain down<br/>
into the glass basket, darken the brew.<br/>
I set the table, put out a plate of sweets.<br/>
Company comes, they leave<br/>
the kitchen’s dark, then gone.<br/>
Forty years have passed.<br/>
Nothing’s the same<br/>
but let’s drink some coffee.<br/>
We like it dark, even darker.<br/>
I like to see it so clear.<br/>
Coffee tastes more round<br/>
when cooked in the glass percolator.<br/>

I used to be good at pretend —<br/>
once, mixing mud and water<br/>
to make a cake<br/>
for my dolls.<br/>
I would trade<br/>
with my cousin Ervin<br/>
play war for house<br/>
scattering the tiny green soldiers<br/>
and guns in the sand —<br/>
we were also the Red Cross.<br/>
Now I’ve become so rusty.<br/>
It didn’t work to stir up my mother<br/>
from the chicken baskets<br/>
on top of the fridge<br/>
with three chicks<br/>
that hide inside their mother.<br/>
She gave me crayons<br/>
still coloring the map,<br/>
made wings for my son<br/>
so he could fly.<br/>
I need her cloak and<br/>
disappearing ink, the candle<br/>
and book with Little Red Hen<br/>
who plants the seeds and reaps<br/>
the wheat and eats the bread —<br/>
if it’s not too late to get help.<br/>

once I wanted words to become a bridge<br/>
built of lost years<br/>
</p><p>
the line that holds the sky<br/>
upon the water<br/>
with concrete pylons sunk deep below the river<br/>
lifting to the flight of cranes<br/>
</p><p>
wanted words like iron rails to carry freight<br/>
as I trembled beneath<br/>
</p><p>
but the day they wandered upon the bridge<br/>
gazing down<br/>
like I have done, lost in dreams of light<br/>
I could not warn them<br/>
</p><p>
the boy racing like wind the girl behind<br/>
could not save them<br/>
unable to find their speed, unable to fling<br/>
themselves to safety<br/>
brakes smoking burning<br/>
in the face of unstoppable violence<br/>
they were overtaken, broken, spilled —<br/>
</p><p>
words become unspeakable —<br/>
</p><p>
so now I disassemble myself<br/>
pull away from the sun silvering the tracks<br/>
fall into the bloom of algae<br/>
erase lines as we watch helpless<br/>
upon the same shore—<br/>

surrender them to bees, yellow blooms<br/>
rafts of lily pads rooted but floating<br/>

In my own kitchen<br/>
at the counter<br/>
surrounded by apples<br/>
I pull off the stem one by one<br/>
where it attached to the tree<br/>
run my knife blade<br/>
beneath the skin<br/>
round and round<br/>
peel off a spiral of time<br/>
come and gone.<br/>
This time, the pie is for<br/>
my son, his grandmother<br/>
who has passed<br/>
and the man I’d married<br/>
and left, for the family.<br/>
Apples always remind me<br/>
of hearts. Shorn, they reveal<br/>
some bruises.<br/>
It was a difficult divorce<br/>
but not everything I had feared<br/>
happened. It’s been<br/>
twenty years past.<br/>
I cut the apples in half —<br/>
then quarters. The tears<br/>
I pry out<br/>
with the tip of the blade<br/>
to be thrown into the compost.<br/>
I fill the brown bowl<br/>
add the sugar and cinnamon<br/>
roll out the pie crust<br/>
making a circle<br/>
in what will inevitably<br/>
be sliced.<br/>
I wonder now where<br/>
are the lines?<br/>
From my oven<br/>
the smell of burnt sugar<br/>
and apples<br/>
sweet and whole.<br/>

the two wheel bicycle<br/>
with my father.<br/>
He oiled the chain<br/>
clothes-pinned playing cards<br/>
to the spokes, put on the basket<br/>
to carry my lunch.<br/>
By his side, I learned balance<br/>
and took on speed<br/>
centered behind the wide<br/>
handlebars, my hands<br/>
on the white grips<br/>
my feet pedaling.<br/>
One moment he was<br/>
holding me up<br/>
and the next moment<br/>
although I didn’t know it<br/>
he had let go.<br/>
When I wobbled, suddenly<br/>
afraid, he yelled <i>keep going —<br/>
keep going!</i><br/>
Beneath the trees in the driveway<br/>
the distance increasing between us<br/>
I eventually rode until he was out of sight.<br/>
I counted on him.<br/>

That he could hold me was a given<br/>
that he could release me was a gift.<br/>

the hook concealed by a minnow’s body<br/>

if it was a bell that rang in the church tower<br/>
or a parade<br/>
a book returned after long absence<br/>
or part of myself<br/>
half of a prayer<br/>
or if it was a war that called us up<br/>
or a circle we walked in when we were lost<br/>
I didn’t know it was a road<br/>
that could erase every trace<br/>
like a sea that parted<br/>
not just any story<br/>
that opened and took me in<br/>
but one that gathered the shards<br/>
of broken glass and set them like diamonds<br/>
into a life I didn’t know was music<br/>

an escape, an exit, a promise<br/>
bringer of bridges<br/>
a story with no clear beginning<br/>

I was the merging<br/>
and lulled plenitude<br/>
with semaphore and symbol<br/>

leading and following<br/>
opening and opening<br/>
a route of oncoming lights<br/>
rain and brakes and radio waves<br/>
way of anonymous occupants<br/>
lost in reality<br/>
crossed by the wild and invisible<br/>
not home but alternate<br/>
not vision but place of daydream and collision<br/>

walk the same walk<br/>

going out of town<br/>
the cables buried under ground<br/>
benches where the homeless sleep<br/>
the pier where waves break<br/>

ships that ply the harbor<br/>
veins that hold iron and blood<br/>
sinews attaching muscle to bone<br/>

enters water on shore<br/>
in drifts and blooms<br/>
